Based on the essay, here's what Paul Graham shared about his early programming experiences:

## First Computers and Programming Languages

Paul Graham's programming journey began on an IBM 1401 computer when he was 13 or 14 years old (in 9th grade). The computer was located in the basement of his junior high school, which he described as ""like a mini Bond villain's lair"" with ""alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.""

On this IBM 1401, he programmed using an early version of Fortran. The programming process was quite different from today:
- Programs had to be typed on punch cards
- The cards were stacked in a card reader
- A button was pressed to load the program into memory and run it
- Results were typically printed on what he called a ""spectacularly loud printer""

Later, around 1980, after ""years of nagging,"" he convinced his father to buy him a TRS-80 microcomputer. While he mentions that ""the gold standard then was the Apple II,"" the TRS-80 was ""good enough"" for his needs.

## Early Programming Challenges

Graham faced several challenges with his early programming:

1. **Limited input options**: With the IBM 1401, he was puzzled about what to do with it since ""the only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,"" and he didn't have any such data.

2. **Limited knowledge**: He notes that another option was ""to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type.""

3. **Infinite loops**: One memorable experience was when he learned ""it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't."" On a machine without time-sharing capabilities, this was both a ""social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.""

4. **Memory constraints**: When he later wrote a word processor on his TRS-80 that his father used to write at least one book, it could only hold ""about 2 pages of text"" in memory at a time, so his father ""would write 2 pages at a time and then print them out.""

Once he got his TRS-80, his programming really took off. He mentions writing ""simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor.""

Would you like to know more about his later programming experiences or how these early experiences influenced his career?"

Based on my research of Paul Graham's essay, I can identify the two specific influences that led him to develop an interest in AI during his college years:

## Two Key Influences on Paul Graham's Interest in AI

### 1. Heinlein's Novel ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" 
This science fiction novel featured an intelligent computer called Mike that captured Graham's imagination. The book drew him completely into its world and convinced him that true artificial intelligence was possible. As Graham writes, ""it seemed only a matter of time before we'd have Mike.""

### 2. PBS Documentary Featuring Terry Winograd and SHRDLU
The documentary showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU, an early natural language understanding computer program. This demonstration had a profound impact on Graham, making him believe that advanced AI was achievable in the near future. As he states: ""when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.""

These two influences were so powerful that Graham abandoned his original major in philosophy (which he found disappointing and ""boring"") to pursue AI instead. He was so captivated by SHRDLU that he later reverse-engineered it for his undergraduate thesis, describing the work as something he ""loved"" and found ""exciting.""

I'll look into Paul Graham's essay to find information about his initial interest in AI and subsequent disillusionment.

<ToolCall name=""paul_graham_Knowledge_Base"" args=""%7B%22input%22%3A%22Paul%20Graham%20initial%20interest%20in%20AI%20influences%20disillusionment%20hoax%22%7D"" id=""toolu_01NePKKSSgmq9xC18jRhp2pY""></ToolCall>



Based on the essay, I can provide information about Paul Graham's initial interest in AI and his later disillusionment with it.

## Paul Graham's Initial Interest in AI

According to the essay, two main influences drew Paul Graham to artificial intelligence:

1. **Heinlein's Novel**: ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" - This science fiction novel featured an intelligent computer named Mike that captured Graham's imagination. After reading it, he felt it was ""only a matter of time"" before we'd have intelligent computers like Mike.

2. **PBS Documentary on SHRDLU**: Graham watched a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU, a natural language understanding program. This demonstration convinced him that advanced AI was achievable ""in a few years at most"" - he thought ""all you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.""

These influences were so powerful that Graham became deeply invested in AI. He even chose ""Artificial Intelligence"" as his major at Cornell (though amusingly, his diploma included quotation marks around the field name, which he later found ""amusingly accurate"").

## His Disillusionment with AI

Graham's realization about AI being a ""hoax"" came during his first year of graduate school at Harvard. While he doesn't recall the exact moment, he came to understand that AI as practiced at that time was fundamentally flawed.

His key realization was that the contemporary approach to AI - where programs translated statements like ""the dog is sitting on the chair"" into formal representations and stored them as ""knowledge"" - was not going to work. As he explains:

>""What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work.""

Graham concluded that this symbolic, knowledge-representation approach to AI might generate opportunities to write academic papers about ""various band-aids,"" but it was ""never going to get us Mike"" - referring to the intelligent computer from the Heinlein novel that had inspired him initially.

After this realization, Graham pivoted away from AI and focused more deeply on Lisp programming language, which he had learned because of its association with AI but found interesting in its own right.

## Paul Graham's Journey with Lisp

Based on the information, Paul Graham's interest in Lisp and how he furthered his understanding were quite significant parts of his career journey:

### Reasons for his shift towards Lisp:

1. **Connection to AI**: Graham initially encountered Lisp when trying to teach himself artificial intelligence. As he notes, ""in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.""

2. **Intellectual expansion**: Learning Lisp dramatically changed his concept of programming: ""Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were.""

3. **Elegance and power**: He was attracted to Lisp's power and elegance compared to other languages available at the time. He mentions that Lisp ""had a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.""

4. **Theoretical foundations**: Graham appreciated that Lisp wasn't just a programming language but originated as a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine, giving it unique properties.

5. **Intellectual fascination**: He recognized that ""Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI,"" which helped him focus on it when his AI aspirations didn't proceed as planned.

### How he furthered his understanding of Lisp:

1. **Writing books**: Graham wrote multiple books on Lisp:
   - ""On Lisp"" (started in grad school, published in 1993)
   - ""ANSI Common Lisp"" (a more accessible, textbook-style book)
   - He admits: ""It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it.""

2. **Practical application**: He used Lisp at Viaweb, his startup, applying it to build real-world commercial software.

3. **Creating new Lisp dialects**: 
   - He worked on a dialect called Arc
   - Later spent 4 years (2015-2019) developing another Lisp dialect called Bel, which he wrote ""in itself in Arc""

4. **Academic exploration**: He explored Lisp's theoretical foundations, particularly John McCarthy's original axiomatic approach.

5. **Professional experience**: He worked as a Lisp programmer at Interleaf, where they had added a dialect of Lisp as a scripting language.

Graham's journey with Lisp spans decades, from his initial encounter in college to creating his own dialects later in life. His appreciation for the language grew from both theoretical understanding and practical application, eventually becoming a significant part of his identity as a programmer and entrepreneur.

I'll explore how Paul Graham attempted to reconcile his interests in computer science and art during his graduate school years. Let me search for the relevant information in his essay.

<ToolCall name=""paul_graham_Knowledge_Base"" args=""%7B%22input%22%3A%22Paul%20Graham%20computer%20science%20art%20grad%20school%20reconcile%20interests%22%7D"" id=""toolu_01D1cfP5UsjoARRVqsbKkveM""></ToolCall>



Based on Paul Graham's essay, I can provide insight into how he attempted to reconcile his interests in computer science and art during his graduate school years.

## 📚 Computer Science and Art: Graham's Dual Path

During his time as a PhD student in computer science at Harvard, Paul Graham was experiencing an interesting internal conflict between his technical interests and his artistic aspirations. 

### The Unexpected Art Journey

While enrolled in the computer science PhD program, Graham began taking art classes at Harvard. He writes:

> ""That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.""

This shows how Graham started exploring his artistic interests even while formally pursuing computer science. His advisor's permissive attitude allowed him to pursue this unconventional path.

### Working Simultaneously on Multiple Passions

Graham explicitly acknowledges his divided attention during this period:

> ""So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.""

This quote perfectly captures his attempt to reconcile these seemingly disparate interests. Rather than choosing one over the other, he pursued both simultaneously, working on his Lisp programming book while also nurturing his artistic ambitions.

### A Moment of Realization

A pivotal moment came during a visit to the Carnegie Institute while visiting a friend at CMU:

> ""While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.""

This insight about the permanence of art contrasted with his experience in computer science, where work quickly became outdated. This appears to have strengthened his interest in art as a potential career path.

### Taking Action on His Art Ambitions

Graham's commitment to exploring his artistic side was serious. He applied to art schools while still completing his computer science dissertation:

> ""Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence... RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.""

After finishing his PhD (which he completed primarily to ""get out of grad school""), he actually enrolled in RISD to formally study art, even though it meant essentially going to college again at age 25.

## 🔄 The Eventual Synthesis

While Graham didn't fully reconcile these interests during grad school itself, his essay shows how he moved between these two worlds, eventually finding ways to express both his technical and artistic inclinations. He would later go on to found successful tech companies like Viaweb and Y Combinator, while also becoming known for his essays - a form of writing that perhaps represents his own unique synthesis of logical thinking and creative expression.

What stands out in Graham's journey is his willingness to pursue both paths simultaneously rather than feeling forced to choose between them, even when it meant dividing his attention and taking an unconventional approach to his graduate education.

Let me search for information about Paul Graham's decision to write a book on Lisp hacking and his reasoning behind it.

<ToolCall name=""paul_graham_Knowledge_Base"" args=""%7B%22input%22%3A%22Paul%20Graham%20writing%20book%20Lisp%20hacking%20limited%20knowledge%20reasons%22%7D"" id=""toolu_01SXrm3zrUiTCHZTCJo6YpR5""></ToolCall>



Based on the information I found, Paul Graham did indeed write about his decision to write a book on Lisp hacking despite limited knowledge. Here's my analysis of his reasons and approach:

## 📚 Graham's Decision to Write a Lisp Book

### Reasons for Writing About Lisp Despite Limited Knowledge
1. **Interest in Lisp as a Unique Language**: Graham found Lisp interesting ""for its own sake"" beyond its association with AI, which was the main reason others valued it at that time.

2. **Learning Through Teaching**: As he directly states: ""It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it.""

3. **Salvaging His Original Plans**: When his initial plans didn't work out, he looked for what he could salvage, and Lisp was there. This shows his adaptability and ability to pivot.

4. **Financial Necessity**: For his second Lisp book, he mentions being ""nervous about money"" and noticed that ""Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare."" He hoped to ""live frugally off the royalties"" while pursuing painting.

5. **Passion for Building**: Graham identified himself as a ""systems person"" who wanted to build things rather than just prove theoretical concepts, and Lisp enabled that creativity.

### Reflection of His Approach to Learning and Problem-Solving

This decision reveals several key aspects of Graham's approach:

1. **Learning by Doing**: He jumps into projects before mastering them, using the project itself as the learning vehicle. This shows a hands-on, experiential approach to learning.

2. **Comfort with Uncertainty**: Graham was willing to embark on writing a book despite acknowledging his limited expertise, demonstrating comfort with uncertainty and learning as he goes.

3. **Following Genuine Interest**: He repeatedly followed what genuinely interested him rather than what might have been more conventional or immediately practical.

4. **Connecting Different Domains**: Graham's approach demonstrates a willingness to combine different interests and expertise areas (programming, writing, art) in unexpected ways.

5. **Platonic Idealism**: He mentions that Lisp hackers have ""in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of,"" showing his tendency to pursue ideals and improve upon existing solutions.

This approach carried through to his later work, when he spent years developing Bel, a new dialect of Lisp that proceeded from McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. His willingness to dive into challenging projects with incomplete knowledge but strong interest appears to be a consistent pattern throughout his career.

What interests you most about Graham's approach to learning and problem-solving? Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of his work in more detail?"

<ToolCall name=""paul_graham_Knowledge_Base"" args=""%7B%22input%22%3A%22Paul%20Graham%20writing%20book%20Lisp%20hacking%20limited%20knowledge%20reasons%22%7D"" id=""toolu_01SXrm3zrUiTCHZTCJo6YpR5""></ToolCall>



Based on the information I found, Paul Graham did indeed write about his decision to write a book on Lisp hacking despite limited knowledge. Here's my analysis of his reasons and approach:

## 📚 Graham's Decision to Write a Lisp Book

### Reasons for Writing About Lisp Despite Limited Knowledge
1. **Interest in Lisp as a Unique Language**: Graham found Lisp interesting ""for its own sake"" beyond its association with AI, which was the main reason others valued it at that time.

2. **Learning Through Teaching**: As he directly states: ""It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it.""

3. **Salvaging His Original Plans**: When his initial plans didn't work out, he looked for what he could salvage, and Lisp was there. This shows his adaptability and ability to pivot.

4. **Financial Necessity**: For his second Lisp book, he mentions being ""nervous about money"" and noticed that ""Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare."" He hoped to ""live frugally off the royalties"" while pursuing painting.

5. **Passion for Building**: Graham identified himself as a ""systems person"" who wanted to build things rather than just prove theoretical concepts, and Lisp enabled that creativity.

### Reflection of His Approach to Learning and Problem-Solving

This decision reveals several key aspects of Graham's approach:

1. **Learning by Doing**: He jumps into projects before mastering them, using the project itself as the learning vehicle. This shows a hands-on, experiential approach to learning.

2. **Comfort with Uncertainty**: Graham was willing to embark on writing a book despite acknowledging his limited expertise, demonstrating comfort with uncertainty and learning as he goes.

3. **Following Genuine Interest**: He repeatedly followed what genuinely interested him rather than what might have been more conventional or immediately practical.

4. **Connecting Different Domains**: Graham's approach demonstrates a willingness to combine different interests and expertise areas (programming, writing, art) in unexpected ways.

5. **Platonic Idealism**: He mentions that Lisp hackers have ""in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of,"" showing his tendency to pursue ideals and improve upon existing solutions.

This approach carried through to his later work, when he spent years developing Bel, a new dialect of Lisp that proceeded from McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. His willingness to dive into challenging projects with incomplete knowledge but strong interest appears to be a consistent pattern throughout his career.

What interests you most about Graham's approach to learning and problem-solving? Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of his work in more detail?"

Based on the information from Paul Graham's essay, I can tell you about his quick decision regarding graduation:

## The Quick Graduation Decision

While in graduate school, Paul Graham was feeling stuck and unhappy. He mentions that he ""didn't want to drop out of grad school"" but was looking for a way out. He even envied his friend Robert Morris for getting kicked out of Cornell (for writing the internet worm of 1988) as it provided an escape from grad school.

The opportunity came unexpectedly in April 1990 when he ran into Professor Cheatham, who asked if Graham was far enough along to graduate that June. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham made what he describes as ""the quickest bit of thinking in my life"" and decided to attempt writing his entire dissertation in just 5 weeks before the deadline.

### How he planned to execute it:

1. He immediately responded to Professor Cheatham with ""Yes, I think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.""
2. He planned to write the dissertation in approximately 5 weeks
3. He would reuse parts from his work ""On Lisp"" where possible
4. He chose ""applications of continuations"" as his topic (though he later reflects that he should have written about macros and embedded languages)

Graham notes that his ""rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely"" to get him out of grad school. After graduating, he applied to art schools and was accepted to RISD (Rhode Island School of Design), where he went next.

What other aspects of Paul Graham's career journey would you like to know about?"

Let me search for information about Paul Graham's experience at the Accademia di Belli Arti to answer your question about the learning environment there.

<ToolCall name=""paul_graham_Knowledge_Base"" args=""%7B%22input%22%3A%22Paul%20Graham%20Accademia%20di%20Belli%20Arti%20experience%20students%20faculty%20interaction%20teaching%20approach%22%7D"" id=""toolu_01WKqz1TGhWoGX5EwhoyEyoh""></ToolCall>



Based on Paul Graham's account, here's what we can learn about the atmosphere and practices at the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence:

## The Learning Environment at Accademia di Belli Arti

### Faculty-Student Interaction
Paul Graham describes the Accademia as a ""very civilized joke"" where both students and faculty had arrived at an informal arrangement:
- The students and faculty were described as ""the nicest people you could imagine""
- Students ""wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything""
- In return, ""the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything""

### Teaching Approach
The teaching approach at the Accademia appeared quite hands-off:
- Graham had a teacher named ""professor Ulivi,"" whom he described as ""a nice guy"" who recognized Graham's hard work and gave him good grades
- Despite this positive personal interaction, Graham states plainly that ""the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian""
- The institution seemed to lack academic rigor, as Graham later compared it unfavorably to other departments he encountered at RISD (Rhode Island School of Design)

### General Atmosphere
The atmosphere maintained a traditional appearance while lacking substantive education:
- All involved ""would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier""
- They even had ""one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings""
- There was a nude model who sat near the stove, but ""hardly anyone else painted her besides me""
- Most students spent their time ""chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art""

### International Student Experience
As a foreign student (straniero), Graham had a somewhat different experience:
- Foreign students had to take an entrance exam, which might have been ""a way of excluding them"" since there were ""so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying art in Florence""
- Graham managed to pass the written exam by writing about Cezanne and elevating the intellectual level of his essay to compensate for his limited Italian vocabulary

In summary, the Accademia di Belli Arti as described by Graham was a place where tradition and appearances were maintained, but genuine art education was minimal. The faculty-student relationship was cordial but lacked academic substance, with little actual teaching or learning taking place despite the institution's prestigious history as ""the oldest art school."""

I'll look up information about Paul Graham's experience with painting still lives in his essay. Let me search for that specific content.

<ToolCall name=""paul_graham_Knowledge_Base"" args=""%7B%22input%22%3A%22Paul%20Graham%20painting%20still%20life%20visual%20perception%22%7D"" id=""toolu_012KNw9MYeXeTpXorN67UjiK""></ToolCall>



Based on Paul Graham's essay, I can explain the differences between painting still lives versus people and the benefits of still life painting for visual perception.

## 🎨 Still Life vs. Portrait Painting

### Key Differences:

1. **Subject Movement**
   - Still lives: ""The subject, as its name suggests, can't move.""
   - People: ""People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.""

2. **Approach to Painting**
   - Still lives: Can be copied ""pixel by pixel from what you're seeing"" if desired.
   - People: Requires knowing ""how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person.""

3. **Time Constraints**
   - Still lives: Can be studied for extended periods without change.
   - People: Limited sitting time creates time pressure for the artist.

4. **Technical Note**
   Graham mentions that ""You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.""

## 👁️ Benefits of Still Life Painting for Visual Perception

Graham found still life painting valuable because it enhanced his visual perception in several ways:

1. **Deeper Seeing**
   - ""In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing.""
   - Painting forces you to ""look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see.""

2. **Bypassing Perceptual Filters**
   - Normal perception: ""Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain 'that's a water droplet' without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or 'that's a bush' without telling you the shape and position of every leaf.""
   - Painting reverses this filter: You notice details that would normally be filtered out.

3. **Continuous Discovery**
   - ""You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted.""
   - This process of discovery is similar to what happens when writing essays about overlooked subjects.

4. **Enhanced Realism**
   - By studying and emphasizing visual cues (like color changes at the edge of objects), Graham suggests artists can ""make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.""

Graham's experience with still life painting shows how it trained him to see beyond the brain's automatic perceptual shortcuts and engage more deeply with visual reality. This enhanced perception was valuable to him not just as an artistic skill but as a way of experiencing the world more richly and completely.

Based on the information retrieved, I can provide details about Paul Graham's experience at Interleaf.

## Interleaf's Unique Software Feature

✨ **The Innovative Feature**
Interleaf had added a scripting language to their document creation software, which was notably a dialect of Lisp. As Graham mentions:

> ""Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp.""

## Significance of This Feature

This was significant because:
1. It was inspired by Emacs, a powerful text editor known for its extensive customization capabilities
2. Choosing Lisp was unconventional — Lisp was not a mainstream language but offered powerful programming paradigms
3. This was an early attempt at making document software extensible through scripting
4. It represented a high-end approach to document creation software (though Graham later learned that ""low end software tends to eat high end software"")

## Graham's Role and Self-Assessment

🔹 **His Role**
Graham was hired specifically as a ""Lisp hacker to write things"" using Interleaf's Lisp dialect. This was the closest thing to a conventional job in his career.

🔹 **Self-Assessment**
Graham is remarkably candid about his performance, stating:

> ""I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee.""

He elaborates on why he struggled:

1. ""Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake""
2. He didn't know C and wasn't motivated to learn it
3. He ""never understood most of the software""
4. He describes himself as ""terribly irresponsible""
5. He struggled with conventional office hours, which ""seemed unnatural"" to him
6. Toward the end of his time there, he spent much of his time ""surreptitiously working on On Lisp"" (his own book project)

## What He Learned at Interleaf

Despite his self-described poor performance, Graham gained valuable insights from his time at Interleaf:

- Technology companies should be run by product people rather than sales people
- Too many people editing code leads to bugs
- Cheap office space can be counterproductive if it's depressing
- Spontaneous corridor conversations are better than planned meetings
- Large bureaucratic customers can be a dangerous source of money
- Conventional office hours and locations aren't optimal for programming
- Most importantly, he learned that ""the low end eats the high end"" — a principle he later applied at both Viaweb and Y Combinator

His time at Interleaf also introduced him indirectly to HTML, though he initially ignored it, not realizing it would later become ""a big part of [his] life.""
