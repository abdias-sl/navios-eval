      "Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.",
      "I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.",
      "What I Worked On\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it.

The computer was located in the basement of his junior high school, which he described as \"like a mini Bond villain's lair\" with \"alien-looking machines \u2014 CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader \u2014 sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\"\n\nOn this IBM 1401, he programmed using an early version of Fortran. The programming process was quite different from today:\n- Programs had to be typed on punch cards\n- The cards were stacked in a card reader\n- A button was pressed to load the program into memory and run it\n- Results were typically printed on what he called a \"spectacularly loud printer\"\n\nLater, around 1980, after \"years of nagging,\" he convinced his father to buy him a TRS-80 microcomputer. While he mentions that \"the gold standard then was the Apple II,\" the TRS-80 was \"good enough\" for his needs.\n\n## Early Programming Challenges\n\nGraham faced several challenges with his early programming:\n\n1. **Limited input options**: With the IBM 1401, he was puzzled about what to do with it since \"the only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\" and he didn't have any such data.\n\n2. **Limited knowledge**: He notes that another option was \"to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type.\"\n\n3. **Infinite loops**: One memorable experience was when he learned \"it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't.\" On a machine without time-sharing capabilities, this was both a \"social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.\"\n\n4. **Memory constraints**: When he later wrote a word processor on his TRS-80 that his father used to write at least one book, it could only hold \"about 2 pages of text\" in memory at a time, so his father \"would write 2 pages at a time and then print them out.\"\n\nOnce he got his TRS-80, his programming really took off. He mentions writing \"simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor.\"\n\nWould you like to know more about his later programming experiences or how these early experiences influenced his career?",

We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known each other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from our personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted tree.\n\n[19] One way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs discovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.\n\nBut if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved."

Heinlein's Novel \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" \nThis science fiction novel featured an intelligent computer called Mike that captured Graham's imagination. The book drew him completely into its world and convinced him that true artificial intelligence was possible. As Graham writes, \"it seemed only a matter of time before we'd have Mike.\"\n\n### 2. PBS Documentary Featuring Terry Winograd and SHRDLU\nThe documentary showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU, an early natural language understanding computer program. This demonstration had a profound impact on Graham, making him believe that advanced AI was achievable in the near future. As he states: \"when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\"\n\nThese two influences were so powerful that Graham abandoned his original major in philosophy (which he found disappointing and \"boring\") to pursue AI instead.

After reading it, he felt it was \"only a matter of time\" before we'd have intelligent computers like Mike.\n\n2. **PBS Documentary on SHRDLU**: Graham watched a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU, a natural language understanding program.

He even chose \"Artificial Intelligence\" as his major at Cornell (though amusingly, his diploma included quotation marks around the field name, which he later found \"amusingly accurate\").\n\n## His Disillusionment with AI\n\nGraham's realization about AI being a \"hoax\" came during his first year of graduate school at Harvard. While he doesn't recall the exact moment, he came to understand that AI as practiced at that time was fundamentally flawed.\n\nHis key realization was that the contemporary approach to AI - where programs translated statements like \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" into formal representations and stored them as \"knowledge\" - was not going to work. As he explains:\n\n>\"What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.

If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]",
      "So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.\n\nComputer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for theory \u2014 indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves \u2014 but building things seemed so much more exciting.",
      "The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\n\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]",
      "McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time.",
      "Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.\n\nI wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast, but fast enough to test.",
      "There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.",
      "McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way \u2014 indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.",

    "response": "## Paul Graham's Journey with Lisp\n\nBased on the information, Paul Graham's interest in Lisp and how he furthered his understanding were quite significant parts of his career journey:\n\n### Reasons for his shift towards Lisp:\n\n1. **Connection to AI**: Graham initially encountered Lisp when trying to teach himself artificial intelligence. As he notes, \"in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\"\n\n2. **Intellectual expansion**: Learning Lisp dramatically changed his concept of programming: \"Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were.\"\n\n3. **Elegance and power**: He was attracted to Lisp's power and elegance compared to other languages available at the time. He mentions that Lisp \"had a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.\"\n\n4. **Theoretical foundations**: Graham appreciated that Lisp wasn't just a programming language but originated as a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine, giving it unique properties.\n\n5. **Intellectual fascination**: He recognized that \"Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI,\" which helped him focus on it when his AI aspirations didn't proceed as planned.\n\n### How he furthered his understanding of Lisp:\n\n1. **Writing books**: Graham wrote multiple books on Lisp:\n   - \"On Lisp\" (started in grad school, published in 1993)\n   - \"ANSI Common Lisp\" (a more accessible, textbook-style book)\n   - He admits: \"It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it.\"\n\n2. **Practical application**: He used Lisp at Viaweb, his startup, applying it to build real-world commercial software.\n\n3. **Creating new Lisp dialects**: \n   - He worked on a dialect called Arc\n   - Later spent 4 years (2015-2019) developing another Lisp dialect called Bel, which he wrote \"in itself in Arc\"\n\n4. **Academic exploration**: He explored Lisp's theoretical foundations, particularly John McCarthy's original axiomatic approach.\n\n5. **Professional experience**: He worked as a Lisp programmer at Interleaf, where they had added a dialect of Lisp as a scripting language.\n\nGraham's journey with Lisp spans decades, from his initial encounter in college to creating his own dialects later in life. His appreciation for the language grew from both theoretical understanding and practical application, eventually becoming a significant part of his identity as a programmer and entrepreneur.\n\nWhat aspects of Graham's journey with Lisp do you find most interesting?",

To further his understanding of Lisp, he decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. He mentions that writing a book about something can help you learn it.

I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\n\nI'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages.

You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial Intelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes.

While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.\n\nAnd moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get research funding.",
      "In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.",
      "There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.\n\nI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]",
      "Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.",
      "She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager.

Then I'll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.",

Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\n\nI don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows."

    "response": "Based on Paul Graham's essay, I can provide insight into how he attempted to reconcile his interests in computer science and art during his graduate school years.\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Computer Science and Art: Graham's Dual Path\n\nDuring his time as a PhD student in computer science at Harvard, Paul Graham was experiencing an interesting internal conflict between his technical interests and his artistic aspirations. \n\n### The Unexpected Art Journey\n\nWhile enrolled in the computer science PhD program, Graham began taking art classes at Harvard. He writes:\n\n> \"That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.\"\n\nThis shows how Graham started exploring his artistic interests even while formally pursuing computer science. His advisor's permissive attitude allowed him to pursue this unconventional path.\n\n### Working Simultaneously on Multiple Passions\n\nGraham explicitly acknowledges his divided attention during this period:\n\n> \"So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.\"\n\nThis quote perfectly captures his attempt to reconcile these seemingly disparate interests. Rather than choosing one over the other, he pursued both simultaneously, working on his Lisp programming book while also nurturing his artistic ambitions.\n\n### A Moment of Realization\n\nA pivotal moment came during a visit to the Carnegie Institute while visiting a friend at CMU:\n\n> \"While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.\"\n\nThis insight about the permanence of art contrasted with his experience in computer science, where work quickly became outdated. This appears to have strengthened his interest in art as a potential career path.\n\n### Taking Action on His Art Ambitions\n\nGraham's commitment to exploring his artistic side was serious. He applied to art schools while still completing his computer science dissertation:\n\n> \"Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence... RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\"\n\nAfter finishing his PhD (which he completed primarily to \"get out of grad school\"), he actually enrolled in RISD to formally study art, even though it meant essentially going to college again at age 25.\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 The Eventual Synthesis\n\nWhile Graham didn't fully reconcile these interests during grad school itself, his essay shows how he moved between these two worlds, eventually finding ways to express both his technical and artistic inclinations. He would later go on to found successful tech companies like Viaweb and Y Combinator, while also becoming known for his essays - a form of writing that perhaps represents his own unique synthesis of logical thinking and creative expression.\n\nWhat stands out in Graham's journey is his willingness to pursue both paths simultaneously rather than feeling forced to choose between them, even when it meant dividing his attention and taking an unconventional approach to his graduate education.\n\nWould you like me to explore any particular aspect of Graham's journey in more detail?",

He found himself in a complex situation where he was simultaneously exploring different fields and trying to reconcile his interests.\n\nIn terms of computer science, Graham was particularly interested in Lisp, a programming language. He decided to write a book about Lisp hacking, titled \"On Lisp,\" as a way to deepen his understanding of the language. He was also intrigued by the idea of building things that would last, which he felt was a challenge in the field of systems work in computer science as any program written would eventually become obsolete.\n\nOn the other hand, Graham also developed a fascination with art. He was inspired by a visit to the Carnegie Institute where he realized that paintings, unlike software, do not become obsolete and can last for hundreds of years. This realization led him to consider the possibility of becoming an artist himself. Despite having no prior experience, he started taking art classes at Harvard while still being in the PhD program.\n\nGraham found himself working on multiple projects that were not related to his thesis. He was writing his book on Lisp, taking art classes, and still trying to complete his PhD. He was in a dilemma about how to reconcile his varied interests and find a way out of grad school.\n\nA turning point came when his professor asked if he was ready to graduate. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham decided to write one in the remaining weeks before the deadline, reusing parts of his book \"On Lisp\" where he could. This decision reflects his attempt to reconcile his interests by integrating his work on Lisp into his academic obligations."

    "response": "Based on the information I found, Paul Graham did indeed write about his decision to write a book on Lisp hacking despite limited knowledge. Here's my analysis of his reasons and approach:\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Graham's Decision to Write a Lisp Book\n\n### Reasons for Writing About Lisp Despite Limited Knowledge\n1. **Interest in Lisp as a Unique Language**: Graham found Lisp interesting \"for its own sake\" beyond its association with AI, which was the main reason others valued it at that time.\n\n2. **Learning Through Teaching**: As he directly states: \"It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it.\"\n\n3. **Salvaging His Original Plans**: When his initial plans didn't work out, he looked for what he could salvage, and Lisp was there. This shows his adaptability and ability to pivot.\n\n4. **Financial Necessity**: For his second Lisp book, he mentions being \"nervous about money\" and noticed that \"Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare.\" He hoped to \"live frugally off the royalties\" while pursuing painting.\n\n5. **Passion for Building**: Graham identified himself as a \"systems person\" who wanted to build things rather than just prove theoretical concepts, and Lisp enabled that creativity.\n\n### Reflection of His Approach to Learning and Problem-Solving\n\nThis decision reveals several key aspects of Graham's approach:\n\n1. **Learning by Doing**: He jumps into projects before mastering them, using the project itself as the learning vehicle. This shows a hands-on, experiential approach to learning.\n\n2. **Comfort with Uncertainty**: Graham was willing to embark on writing a book despite acknowledging his limited expertise, demonstrating comfort with uncertainty and learning as he goes.\n\n3. **Following Genuine Interest**: He repeatedly followed what genuinely interested him rather than what might have been more conventional or immediately practical.\n\n4. **Connecting Different Domains**: Graham's approach demonstrates a willingness to combine different interests and expertise areas (programming, writing, art) in unexpected ways.\n\n5. **Platonic Idealism**: He mentions that Lisp hackers have \"in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of,\" showing his tendency to pursue ideals and improve upon existing solutions.\n\nThis approach carried through to his later work, when he spent years developing Bel, a new dialect of Lisp that proceeded from McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. His willingness to dive into challenging projects with incomplete knowledge but strong interest appears to be a consistent pattern throughout his career.\n\nWhat interests you most about Graham's approach to learning and problem-solving? Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of his work in more detail?",
    "reference": "The author decided to write a book on Lisp hacking primarily because he found Lisp interesting in its own right, separate from its association with AI. He also believed that writing a book about something is a good way to learn it. This reflects his approach to learning and problem-solving as being hands-on and experiential. He's not afraid to dive into a subject he's not fully versed in, using the process of writing and explaining to deepen his understanding. This approach suggests a willingness to take risks and learn through doing, rather than relying solely on prior knowledge or expertise."

What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer.

The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art",
      "What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway."

    "response": "Based on Paul Graham's essay, I can explain the differences between painting still lives versus people and the benefits of still life painting for visual perception.\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 Still Life vs. Portrait Painting\n\n### Key Differences:\n\n1. **Subject Movement**\n   - Still lives: \"The subject, as its name suggests, can't move.\"\n   - People: \"People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\"\n\n2. **Approach to Painting**\n   - Still lives: Can be copied \"pixel by pixel from what you're seeing\" if desired.\n   - People: Requires knowing \"how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person.\"\n\n3. **Time Constraints**\n   - Still lives: Can be studied for extended periods without change.\n   - People: Limited sitting time creates time pressure for the artist.\n\n4. **Technical Note**\n   Graham mentions that \"You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\"\n\n## \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Benefits of Still Life Painting for Visual Perception\n\nGraham found still life painting valuable because it enhanced his visual perception in several ways:\n\n1. **Deeper Seeing**\n   - \"In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing.\"\n   - Painting forces you to \"look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see.\"\n\n2. **Bypassing Perceptual Filters**\n   - Normal perception: \"Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain 'that's a water droplet' without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or 'that's a bush' without telling you the shape and position of every leaf.\"\n   - Painting reverses this filter: You notice details that would normally be filtered out.\n\n3. **Continuous Discovery**\n   - \"You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted.\"\n   - This process of discovery is similar to what happens when writing essays about overlooked subjects.\n\n4. **Enhanced Realism**\n   - By studying and emphasizing visual cues (like color changes at the edge of objects), Graham suggests artists can \"make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.\"\n\nGraham's experience with still life painting shows how it trained him to see beyond the brain's automatic perceptual shortcuts and engage more deeply with visual reality. This enhanced perception was valuable to him not just as an artistic skill but as a way of experiencing the world more richly and completely.\n\nWould you like me to explain more about any specific aspect of Graham's painting experience or his artistic journey?",
    "reference": "In the essay, the author explains that painting a still life is different from painting a person because the subject of a still life doesn't move, unlike a person who can't sit still for more than about 15 minutes. When painting people, the traditional method is to know how to paint a generic person, which is then modified to match the specific person being painted. In contrast, a still life can be copied pixel by pixel from what the artist is seeing.\n\nThe author suggests that painting still lives allows for a deeper understanding of visual perception. In everyday life, much of what we see is processed by low-level brain functions that provide a general understanding of what we're seeing, without detailing every aspect. However, when painting a still life, the artist must look more closely and notice details that are usually overlooked. The author notes that this process of careful observation can lead to new discoveries even after days of painting something that people usually take for granted. Therefore, painting still lives can enhance visual perception by encouraging a more detailed and conscious observation of the world."

    "retrieved_contexts": [
      "Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.",
      "I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)\n\nThe best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.",
      "I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.",
      "Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.\n\nI wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]",
      "But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.\n\nWhen I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.",
      "The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\n\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]",
      "I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]",
      "Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.\n\nBy then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an \"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long before it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.",
      "I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an interpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.\n\nSo I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone asking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"",
      "This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server."

    "response": "Based on the information retrieved, I can provide details about Paul Graham's experience at Interleaf.\n\n## Interleaf's Unique Software Feature\n\n\u2728 **The Innovative Feature**\nInterleaf had added a scripting language to their document creation software, which was notably a dialect of Lisp. As Graham mentions:\n\n> \"Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp.\"\n\n## Significance of This Feature\n\nThis was significant because:\n1. It was inspired by Emacs, a powerful text editor known for its extensive customization capabilities\n2. Choosing Lisp was unconventional \u2014 Lisp was not a mainstream language but offered powerful programming paradigms\n3. This was an early attempt at making document software extensible through scripting\n4. It represented a high-end approach to document creation software (though Graham later learned that \"low end software tends to eat high end software\")\n\n## Graham's Role and Self-Assessment\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **His Role**\nGraham was hired specifically as a \"Lisp hacker to write things\" using Interleaf's Lisp dialect. This was the closest thing to a conventional job in his career.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Self-Assessment**\nGraham is remarkably candid about his performance, stating:\n\n> \"I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee.\"\n\nHe elaborates on why he struggled:\n\n1. \"Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake\"\n2. He didn't know C and wasn't motivated to learn it\n3. He \"never understood most of the software\"\n4. He describes himself as \"terribly irresponsible\"\n5. He struggled with conventional office hours, which \"seemed unnatural\" to him\n6. Toward the end of his time there, he spent much of his time \"surreptitiously working on On Lisp\" (his own book project)\n\n## What He Learned at Interleaf\n\nDespite his self-described poor performance, Graham gained valuable insights from his time at Interleaf:\n\n- Technology companies should be run by product people rather than sales people\n- Too many people editing code leads to bugs\n- Cheap office space can be counterproductive if it's depressing\n- Spontaneous corridor conversations are better than planned meetings\n- Large bureaucratic customers can be a dangerous source of money\n- Conventional office hours and locations aren't optimal for programming\n- Most importantly, he learned that \"the low end eats the high end\" \u2014 a principle he later applied at both Viaweb and Y Combinator\n\nHis time at Interleaf also introduced him indirectly to HTML, though he initially ignored it, not realizing it would later become \"a big part of [his] life.\"\n\nWould you like me to explore any particular aspect of his Interleaf experience in more detail?",
    "reference": "Interleaf, the company where the author worked, had added a unique feature to their software. Inspired by Emacs, they incorporated a scripting language into their software, which was even made as a dialect of Lisp. This bold move was significant as it allowed for more complex and flexible operations within the software.\n\nThe author's role in the company was to write things in this scripting language, essentially functioning as a Lisp hacker. However, the author self-assesses his performance as poor. He admits to being a bad employee, stating that he didn't understand most of the software because their Lisp was just a thin layer on top of a large amount of C code, a language he didn't know and didn't want to learn. Additionally, he confesses to being terribly irresponsible, particularly in relation to the traditional working hours that were expected at the time."
