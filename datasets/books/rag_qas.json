      "reference_answer": "Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old, creating many lists of books she intended to read regularly through. These lists were well-chosen and neatly arranged, sometimes alphabetically and sometimes by other rules. However, she will never submit to anything requiring industry, patience, and a subjection of fancy to understanding. Miss Taylor failed to stimulate her reading, and Harriet Smith will not be able to either."

      "reference_answer": "Emma believes that Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's in terms of gentleness and could be more safely held up as a pattern. She notes that Mr. Weston has an openness, quickness, and almost bluntness that everyone likes due to his good-humour, but it would not be suitable to copy. Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding manner, while suiting him well due to his figure, look, and situation, would be insufferable if copied by any young man. Emma suggests that a young man could very safely take Mr. Elton as a model, describing him as good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. She observes that his manners have become particularly gentle lately, speculating he might have a design of ingratiating himself with either Emma or Harriet."

Ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of everyone in it, having lost her mother, the only person able to cope with her, who must have kept her under subjection and from whom she inherited her talents."

This collection was inspired by Miss Nash, a head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard’s, who had written out at least three hundred riddles. Emma assists Harriet with her invention, memory, and taste, and Harriet's pretty handwriting makes the collection likely to be of the first order in form and quantity. Mr. Woodhouse is also interested and tries to recall riddles, often ending with 'Kitty, a fair but frozen maid'."

She notes the language is plain but strong and unaffected, and the sentiments conveyed are much to the writer's credit, expressing good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety, and even delicacy of feeling. Emma initially speculates that one of the writer's sisters must have helped him, though she clarifies it is not the style of a woman due to its strength and conciseness. When Harriet asks what to do, Emma advises her to answer it speedily. Emma insists the letter had much better be Harriet's own, stating there is no danger of her not being intelligible and that expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain inflicted will present themselves unbidden. Harriet clarifies that she means to refuse him, and Emma assures her there will be no difficulty in the answer, assisting in the formation of every sentence, as Harriet was very concerned about making him unhappy and what his mother and sisters would think."

He then takes up the open book on the table and examines it very attentively. Emma, trying to ease the awkward moment, states that a charade so good should not be confined to one or two and that the writer can be sure of every woman's approbation when writing with such gallantry. Mr. Elton, though hesitating, replies that if his friend feels as he does, seeing his \"little effusion\" honored in the book would be considered the proudest moment of his life."

The primitive method involved breaking the larger end. However, the grandfather of the present Lilliputian majesty cut his finger while breaking an egg in the ancient practice, leading his father, the emperor, to issue an edict commanding all subjects to break eggs at the smaller end, under severe penalties. This law caused significant public resentment, resulting in six rebellions, during which one emperor lost his life and another his crown. These civil commotions were continually incited by the monarchs of Blefuscu, who offered refuge to the exiles. It is estimated that eleven thousand people suffered death rather than submit to breaking their eggs at the smaller end."

He also contended that the loss of Gulliver's eyes would not impede his bodily strength, allowing him to remain useful to the majesty, and that blindness is an addition to courage by concealing dangers."

It resembles the right whale in length and baleen but has a less portly girth and a lighter, olive-like color. Its distinguishing feature is a prominent fin, three or four feet long, angular, and with a sharp pointed end, growing vertically from the hinder part of its back. This leviathan is considered the \"banished and unconquerable Cain of his race\" because it is not gregarious, seems to be a \"whale-hater\" (like some men are man-haters), always goes solitary, rises unexpectedly in remote waters, and possesses wondrous swimming power and velocity in swimming that defies human pursuit."

These marks appear to be seen through the thin, transparent outer layer of the skin, as if engraved directly upon the body itself.

The narrator notes that like mystic rocks, the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable.
