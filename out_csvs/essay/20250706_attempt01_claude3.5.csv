I didn\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called ""data processing."" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it.

Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were.

I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book.

Based on the essay, here's what Paul Graham shares about his early programming experiences:

His first exposure to programming was on an IBM 1401 computer in 9th grade (when he was 13 or 14). This computer was located in the basement of his junior high school, where the school district used it for ""data processing."" He describes the computer room as being like a ""mini Bond villain's lair"" with alien-looking machines including a CPU, disk drives, printer, and card reader set up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.

The programming language they used was an early version of Fortran. The programming process was quite different from today:
- Programs had to be typed on punch cards
- The cards would be stacked in the card reader
- You had to press a button to load the program into memory and run it
- Output was primarily through a ""spectacularly loud printer""

Graham faced several challenges with this first computer:
1. Limited input options - programs could only receive input through punched cards, and he didn't have any data stored in that format
2. Limited programming possibilities - without data input, he could only write programs that did calculations (like approximating pi), but he didn't know enough math to do anything interesting
3. He encountered his first infinite loop - he learned about programs that don't terminate when one of his programs got stuck, something that was particularly problematic on a machine without time-sharing. The data center manager's expression made it clear this was both a technical and social error.

It wasn't until around 1980 that Graham got his own computer - a TRS-80 - after years of convincing his father to buy one. While the Apple II was considered the ""gold standard"" at the time, the TRS-80 was where he really started programming in earnest. With this computer, he was able to write more practical programs including:
- Simple games
- A program to predict model rocket flight heights
- A word processor (though it could only handle about 2 pages of text at a time)

Based on the text, there were two specific influences that led Paul Graham to develop an interest in AI in the mid-1980s:

1. **The Moon is a Harsh Mistress** (novel by Heinlein): This science fiction novel featured an intelligent computer called Mike. Graham was completely drawn into the world of this book, and it made him believe that such intelligent computers were an achievable future.

2. **PBS documentary featuring Terry Winograd using SHRDLU**: This documentary showed Terry Winograd demonstrating SHRDLU, a natural language understanding computer program. After seeing this demonstration, Graham was so convinced of its potential that he thought we were just a few years away from true AI. He believed that advancing SHRDLU was simply a matter of teaching it more words.

These influences were so significant that Graham actually went on to reverse-engineer SHRDLU for his undergraduate thesis, which he describes as a project he ""loved working on."" Interestingly, while these influences led him to pursue AI initially, he later came to realize during his first year of graduate school that AI (as practiced at that time) was what he called a ""hoax,"" particularly the type that tried to translate simple statements into formal representations.","The two specific influences that led the author to develop an interest in AI were a novel and a documentary.

Based on the essay, I can identify both the initial influences that drew Paul Graham to AI and his eventual realization about its limitations. Here's what he shares:

**Initial Influences (Two Main Ones)**:
1. A novel by Heinlein called ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,"" which featured an intelligent computer named Mike
2. A PBS documentary showing Terry Winograd using SHRDLU (a natural language understanding computer program)

These influences were so compelling that Graham believed that achieving true AI was just around the corner. He specifically mentions thinking that they were only ""a few years at most"" away from having something like Mike (the AI from the novel), and that it was ""just a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words.""

**The Realization**:
During his first year of grad school, Graham came to the realization that AI (as practiced at that time) was what he termed a ""hoax."" His specific insight was about the fundamental limitation of the AI approach of that era, which tried to translate natural language statements (like ""the dog is sitting on the chair"") into formal representations and store them as knowledge.

He explains why this approach was fundamentally flawed:
> ""It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work.""

Graham recognized that while these programs could work with a subset of natural language that behaved like a formal language, this was only a ""very proper subset"" of actual language understanding, and the approach would never lead to truly intelligent systems like the Mike computer he had read about in Heinlein's novel.

This realization led him to pivot away from AI and focus instead on Lisp programming, which he had originally learned because it was considered the language of AI at the time.

Would you like to know more about how this realization affected his subsequent career choices?","The two main influences that initially drew the author to AI were a novel by Heinlein called ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,"" which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU.

Based on the knowledge base search, I can provide a comprehensive overview of the author's journey with Lisp and his reasons for pursuing it. Here are the key points:

1. **Initial Introduction**
- Graham encountered Lisp while trying to learn AI at Cornell, where there weren't any formal AI classes
- At that time, Lisp was considered the language of AI
- The experience was transformative compared to the primitive programming languages of the time (like PL/I)

2. **Reasons for Interest**
- Lisp's power and elegance set it apart from other languages
- Learning Lisp dramatically expanded his concept of what programming could be
- He recognized that Lisp was interesting for its own sake, beyond its association with AI
- He was particularly fascinated by Lisp's origins as a formal model of computation

3. **Deepening Understanding**
- Wrote a book called ""On Lisp"" (published in 1993)
- Started writing it in graduate school, using the book-writing process to deepen his own understanding
- Later wrote another book, ""ANSI Common Lisp,"" intended as a more popular, textbook-style work
- Worked at Interleaf, where he gained practical experience with a Lisp dialect

4. **Advanced Involvement**
- Created his own dialect of Lisp called Arc
- Later developed another Lisp called Bel (from 2015 to 2019)
- Was particularly interested in Lisp's unique feature of being a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself
- Spent significant time exploring and implementing the theoretical foundations of Lisp, particularly following McCarthy's axiomatic approach

The author's journey with Lisp shows a progression from initial fascination to deep expertise, culminating in creating his own Lisp dialects. What stands out is how Lisp aligned with his interest in building things rather than just proving theoretical concepts, despite his respect for the theoretical side of computer science.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of his journey with Lisp, such as his work on creating his own Lisp dialects or his experience writing books about the language?","The author shifted his interest towards Lisp after realizing that the way AI was practiced at the time, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. He found that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, which was the main reason people cared about it at the time. To further his understanding of Lisp, he decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. He mentions that writing a book about something can help you learn it. The book he wrote, ""On Lisp,"" was mostly written during his time in grad school.",0.699999999965,0.8,0.9232651068190642,1.0,0.25,0.5
4,"In the essay, the author mentions his interest in both computer science and art. Discuss how he attempts to reconcile these two interests during his time in grad school. Provide specific examples from the text.","[""I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had no idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually that people made art — that it didn't just appear spontaneously — but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.\n\nThat fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.\n\nSo now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis."", ""I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's a whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.\n\nMeanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\n\nI'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design."", 'In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.', ""In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.\n\nAnd moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get research funding."", 'I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I\'d visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who\'d invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\n\nI don\'t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that\'s told ""the dog is sitting on the chair"" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.', ""There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself.

I knew what I was going to do."", ""I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art"", 'There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who ""could draw"" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.\n\nI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn\'t much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]', ""Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI."", 'I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren\'t consciously aware of much we\'re seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain ""that\'s a water droplet"" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or ""that\'s a bush"" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there\'s a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.\n\nThis is not the only way to paint. I\'m not 100% sure it\'s even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.']","

Based on the text, I can provide a detailed analysis of how Paul Graham attempted to reconcile his interests in computer science and art during his graduate school years:

1. **Parallel Pursuits During PhD**
- While enrolled in a computer science PhD program at Harvard, Graham took advantage of the flexibility offered by his advisor, Tom Cheatham
- He started taking art classes at Harvard, as grad students were allowed to take classes in any department
- His advisor was notably ""easy going"" and didn't comment on these unconventional class choices

2. **Internal Conflict and Multiple Passions**
- Graham describes himself as simultaneously:
  - Being in a computer science PhD program
  - Planning to become an artist
  - Being ""genuinely in love with Lisp hacking"" and working on a project called ""On Lisp""
- He characterizes this as typical grad student behavior of ""working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis""

3. **Transition Point**
- During this period, Graham was working on his dissertation (on continuations) while simultaneously applying to art schools
- He applied to RISD and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence
- His approach to finishing his PhD seems to have been pragmatic - he notes that he ""just wanted to get out of grad school"" and his dissertation ""sufficed, just barely""

4. **Motivation for Art**
A key insight into his interest in art came from a visit to the Carnegie Institute during his grad school years, where he realized two important things about painting:
- Unlike software, paintings don't become obsolete
- Some of the best paintings were hundreds of years old
- It offered a path to true independence, without needing bosses or research funding

5. **Philosophical Connection**
Graham's approach to both fields was driven by curiosity and deep observation. This is particularly evident in his description of painting still lives:
- He was ""curious about what I was seeing""
- He found that both painting and programming allowed him to look more closely at things people usually take for granted
- This suggests he found intellectual satisfaction in both pursuits, even though they were very different disciplines

The essay reveals that Graham's attempt to reconcile these interests wasn't so much about finding a way to combine them directly, but rather about pursuing both simultaneously while learning what each field could offer him. His experience highlights the challenges and opportunities of maintaining dual interests in very different fields during graduate education, ultimately leading him to make a complete transition from computer science to art school after completing his PhD.

Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of this dual pursuit in more detail?","The author in the essay is Paul Graham, who was pursuing a PhD in computer science but also developed an interest in art. He found himself in a complex situation where he was simultaneously exploring different fields and trying to reconcile his interests.

In terms of computer science, Graham was particularly interested in Lisp, a programming language. He decided to write a book about Lisp hacking, titled ""On Lisp,"" as a way to deepen his understanding of the language. He was also intrigued by the idea of building things that would last, which he felt was a challenge in the field of systems work in computer science as any program written would eventually become obsolete.

On the other hand, Graham also developed a fascination with art. He was inspired by a visit to the Carnegie Institute where he realized that paintings, unlike software, do not become obsolete and can last for hundreds of years. This realization led him to consider the possibility of becoming an artist himself. Despite having no prior experience, he started taking art classes at Harvard while still being in the PhD program.

Graham found himself working on multiple projects that were not related to his thesis. He was writing his book on Lisp, taking art classes, and still trying to complete his PhD. He was in a dilemma about how to reconcile his varied interests and find a way out of grad school.

A turning point came when his professor asked if he was ready to graduate. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham decided to write one in the remaining weeks before the deadline, reusing parts of his book ""On Lisp"" where he could. This decision reflects his attempt to reconcile his interests by integrating his work on Lisp into his academic obligations.",0.9999999999,0.8,0.9087639731504181,0.972972972972973,0.5,1.0
5,The author discusses his decision to write a book on Lisp hacking despite his limited knowledge about it. What reasons does he give for this decision and how does this reflect his approach to learning and problem-solving?,"[""So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.\n\nComputer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for theory — indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves — but building things seemed so much more exciting."", ""I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]"", ""The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\n\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.

But we decided we\'d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores — in Lisp, of course.']","

Based on the search results, I can provide insight into Paul Graham's decision to write a book about Lisp hacking and how it reflects his approach to learning and problem-solving. Here are the key points:

1. **Learning Through Teaching**
- Graham acknowledges that he knew very little about Lisp hacking when he started writing the book ""On Lisp""
- He embraced the philosophy that ""there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it""
- This shows his belief in learning by doing and taking on challenging projects

2. **Opportunistic Approach**
- The decision came after a shift in his plans (presumably related to AI work)
- He ""looked around to see what he could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp""
- He recognized Lisp's intrinsic value beyond its association with AI

3. **Practical Motivation**
- Later, he wrote another Lisp book (ANSI Common Lisp) partly due to financial concerns
- He was nervous about money and saw limited opportunities for freelance Lisp work
- This shows his ability to combine intellectual interests with practical needs

4. **Deep Engagement with the Subject**
- Graham's approach to learning Lisp was comprehensive and long-term
- He mentions that learning Lisp ""expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were""
- This reflects his tendency to dive deep into subjects that interest him

His approach to learning and problem-solving is characterized by:
- Willingness to take on ambitious projects despite limited initial knowledge
- Using writing and teaching as learning tools
- Combining practical needs with intellectual interests
- Deep, long-term engagement with subjects
- Being unafraid to start projects without complete expertise

This pattern shows someone who learns through active engagement and is willing to take calculated risks in pursuit of knowledge and opportunity. It also demonstrates that he values hands-on experience and practical application over theoretical knowledge alone.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of his approach to learning or his experience with Lisp?","The author decided to write a book on Lisp hacking primarily because he found Lisp interesting in its own right, separate from its association with AI. He also believed that writing a book about something is a good way to learn it. This reflects his approach to learning and problem-solving as being hands-on and experiential. He's not afraid to dive into a subject he's not fully versed in, using the process of writing and explaining to deepen his understanding.

I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he\'d found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.\n\nThen one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn\'t have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay ""Yes, I think so. I\'ll give you something to read in a few days.""', ""I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages.

I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\n\nI'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages.

We\'d all have dinner there once a week — on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays — and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.', 'For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief — hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 — that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.\n\nI had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn\'t make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose ""Artificial Intelligence."" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.', ""In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners."", ""Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall.

But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely.

That part we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as investors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where they'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out of it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft."", 'The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.', 'As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the ""YC GDP,"" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.']","

Based on the essay, Paul Graham made a quick and significant decision regarding his graduation from grad school in April 1990. When Professor Cheatham asked if he was far enough along to graduate that June, Graham hadn't written a word of his dissertation. However, in what he describes as ""the quickest bit of thinking in my life,"" he decided to attempt writing his entire dissertation in just 5 weeks before the deadline.

His plan to execute this was to:
1. Reuse parts from his work ""On Lisp"" where possible
2. Focus on the topic of ""applications of continuations"" (though he later mentions he should have written about macros and embedded languages instead)
3. Complete the writing within the approximately 5-week deadline

Graham mentions that his ""rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely."" This quick decision was motivated by his desire to get out of grad school, as he had been feeling trapped in the situation. The decision worked out, albeit marginally, and allowed him to move on to his next endeavor, which was attending art school at RISD.

Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine.

So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor.

Based on Paul Graham's account, the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence had a rather laid-back and informal atmosphere that didn't align with what one might expect from a prestigious art institution. Here are the key points about the student-faculty interactions and teaching approach:

1. Informal Agreement:
- There was an implicit arrangement between students and faculty where neither side made demands of the other
- Faculty didn't require students to learn anything
- Students didn't expect faculty to teach anything

2. Traditional Appearance:
- The institution maintained the outward appearance of a 19th-century atelier
- They even had traditional elements like a wood-burning stove and nude models, similar to what you'd see in 19th-century studio paintings

3. Limited Engagement:
- Despite having traditional setups like nude models, few students actually painted
- Most students spent their time chatting or trying to imitate American art
- Graham describes it as a ""very civilized joke""

4. Faculty Attitude:
- His teacher, Professor Ulivi, is described as ""a nice guy"" who appreciated Graham's hard work
- The faculty were generally described as ""the nicest people you could imagine""

5. Learning Environment:
- The school wasn't providing much formal education
- Graham mentions that the only thing he really learned there was Italian
- The atmosphere was very relaxed and unstructured

6. International Dynamic:
- There was a significant presence of foreign students (stranieri)
- The entrance exam was only required for foreign students, possibly as a way to limit their numbers

The overall picture that emerges is of an institution that had become more of a social environment than a rigorous educational one. Despite its prestigious history and traditional trappings, the actual teaching and learning were minimal, with both faculty and students seemingly content with this arrangement. This experience led Graham to conclude that art school didn't have the same relationship to art that medical school had to medicine - it was much less structured and demanding.

Based on Paul Graham's essay, there are several key differences between painting still lives and painting people, as well as important insights about visual perception:

Key Differences in Painting Process:
1. Movement: The fundamental difference is that still lives, as the name suggests, don't move. People, however, can only sit for about 15 minutes at a time and even then don't sit completely still.

2. Approach to Painting:
- Still Lives: Can be copied ""pixel by pixel"" from what you're seeing directly
- People: Requires knowing how to paint a ""generic person"" which you then modify to match the specific individual

3. Time and Observation:
- Still Lives: Allow for extended, detailed observation over long periods
- People: Limited observation time due to subject fatigue and movement

Benefits of Still Life Painting for Visual Perception:
Graham provides fascinating insights about how painting still lives enhances visual perception:

1. Deeper Awareness: In everyday life, we're not consciously aware of much of what we're seeing. Painting still lives forces you to look more closely and notice details that normally bypass our conscious awareness.

2. Breaking Through Automatic Processing: Our brains typically use ""low-level processes"" that simply categorize objects (like ""that's a water droplet"" or ""that's a bush"") without processing detailed information. Painting helps overcome this automatic simplification.

3. Continuous Discovery: Even after days of painting a seemingly simple object, you can continue to notice new details that people usually take for granted. Graham compares this to the process of writing essays about seemingly ordinary topics.

Interestingly, Graham notes that while you can technically paint people like still lives (if they're willing to sit for extended periods), this approach tends to ""produce pained expressions in the sitters."" He also suggests that this type of portrait could be considered ""the apex of still life painting.""

The author's experience suggests that painting still lives serves as a valuable tool for developing deeper observational skills and understanding how we actually perceive the world around us, revealing details and complexities that our brains typically filter out in everyday life.

Would you like to explore more about how Graham's experience with painting influenced his other creative pursuits, such as writing or programming?","In the essay, the author explains that painting a still life is different from painting a person because the subject of a still life doesn't move, unlike a person who can't sit still for more than about 15 minutes. When painting people, the traditional method is to know how to paint a generic person, which is then modified to match the specific person being painted. In contrast, a still life can be copied pixel by pixel from what the artist is seeing.

The author suggests that painting still lives allows for a deeper understanding of visual perception. In everyday life, much of what we see is processed by low-level brain functions that provide a general understanding of what we're seeing, without detailing every aspect. However, when painting a still life, the artist must look more closely and notice details that are usually overlooked. The author notes that this process of careful observation can lead to new discoveries even after days of painting something that people usually take for granted. Therefore, painting still lives can enhance visual perception by encouraging a more detailed and conscious observation of the world.",0.99999999995,1.0,0.9054282584862475,1.0,0.74,1.0

Also, discuss the author's role in the company and his self-assessment of his performance.","[""Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible.

Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish."", ""I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it."", ""The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue combined with Yahoo's prematurely aged culture and grim cube farm in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf."", 'But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it\'s good to be the ""entry level"" option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you\'re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.\n\nWhen I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.', ""Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.\n\nI wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]"", ""This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server."", ""I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)\n\nThe best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant."", ""One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish on my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip."", 'Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.', 'What I Worked On\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called ""data processing."" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.']","

Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive overview of the author's experience at Interleaf:

**Unique Software Feature:**
Interleaf had made a bold innovation by adding a scripting language to their document creation software. Specifically, they had implemented a dialect of Lisp as the scripting language, inspired by Emacs. This was significant because it was an attempt to add programmability to their document creation software, though the Lisp implementation was described as ""the thinnest icing on a giant C cake.""

**Author's Role and Self-Assessment:**
Graham was hired specifically as a Lisp hacker to write programs in this scripting language. However, he is quite candid about his performance, admitting that he was ""a bad employee"" for several reasons:

1. Limited Understanding: Since the software was primarily written in C, which he neither knew nor wanted to learn, he never understood most of the software's architecture.

2. Work Style Conflicts: He struggled with the traditional office environment that required showing up during specific working hours, which he found ""unnatural.""

3. Focus Issues: Toward the end of his time there, he spent much of his time secretly working on his book ""On Lisp,"" for which he had received a publishing contract.

Despite his self-proclaimed poor performance, Graham did learn several valuable business lessons from his time at Interleaf, including:
- Technology companies are better run by product people than sales people
- Too many people editing code leads to bugs
- Cheap office space can be counterproductive if it's depressing
- Informal corridor conversations are more effective than planned meetings
- Large, bureaucratic customers can be a risky source of revenue
- Traditional office hours and locations aren't optimal for programming work

Interestingly, this experience later influenced his future ventures, as he notes that working at Yahoo after selling Viaweb felt ""disconcertingly like working at Interleaf,"" suggesting similar cultural and environmental challenges.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of his experience at Interleaf or the lessons he learned there?","Interleaf, the company where the author worked, had added a unique feature to their software. Inspired by Emacs, they incorporated a scripting language into their software, which was even made as a dialect of Lisp. This bold move was significant as it allowed for more complex and flexible operations within the software.

The author's role in the company was to write things in this scripting language, essentially functioning as a Lisp hacker. However, the author self-assesses his performance as poor. He admits to being a bad employee, stating that he didn't understand most of the software because their Lisp was just a thin layer on top of a large amount of C code, a language he didn't know and didn't want to learn. Additionally, he confesses to being terribly irresponsible, particularly in relation to the traditional working hours that were expected at the time.",0.9999999999,0.8571428571428571,0.9050873958073331,0.9565217391304348,0.5,1.0
