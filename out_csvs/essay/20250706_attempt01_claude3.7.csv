Based on the essay, here's what Paul Graham shares about his early programming experiences:

### First Computer Experiences

Paul Graham's first exposure to programming was on an IBM 1401 computer located in the basement of his junior high school when he was 13 or 14 years old. He describes this environment as ""like a mini Bond villain's lair"" with ""alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.""

### Programming Language

His first programming language was an early version of Fortran. He had to type programs on punch cards, stack them in a card reader, and press a button to load and run the program. The output would typically be printed on what he describes as a ""spectacularly loud printer.""

### Personal Computer

It wasn't until around 1980, after ""years of nagging,"" that his father bought him his own computer - a TRS-80. Although the Apple II was considered the ""gold standard"" at that time, the TRS-80 was ""good enough"" and this is when he ""really started programming.""

### Challenges and Limitations

Graham faced several challenges with his early programming:

1. **Limited Input Options**: On the IBM 1401, the only way to input data was through punched cards, and he didn't have any data stored this way.

2. **Limited Project Ideas**: He mentions being ""puzzled"" by the 1401 and ""couldn't figure out what to do with it."" Without input data, his programming options were severely restricted.

3. **Technical Limitations**: His programs on the TRS-80 had significant memory constraints. For example, the word processor he created for his father could only hold about 2 pages of text in memory at a time.

4. **Learning Curve**: He experienced the classic beginner's problem of creating an infinite loop, noting ""the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't."" This was both a ""social as well as a technical error"" because it tied up the shared machine.

With his TRS-80, he was able to write more practical programs, including simple games, a program to predict how high his model rockets would fly, and that word processor his father used to write at least one book.

Is there any specific aspect of his early programming experiences you'd like me to elaborate on further?","The first computer the author used for programming was the IBM 1401, which was used by his school district for data processing. He started using it in 9th grade, around the age of 13 or 14. The programming language he used was an early version of Fortran. The author faced several challenges while using this computer. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and he didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but he didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. Therefore, he couldn't figure out what to do with it and in retrospect, he believes there's not much he could have done with it.",0.0,1.0,0.8592591801648038,1.0,0.45,0.75

What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn't have put this into words when I was 18.

Based on the information I found, Paul Graham had two specific influences that led him to develop an interest in AI during his college years:

### 1. Heinlein's Novel ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress""
This science fiction novel featured an intelligent computer named Mike that captivated Graham's imagination. The book drew him completely into its world and made him believe that true artificial intelligence was achievable. In his own words, ""it seemed only a matter of time before we'd have Mike.""

### 2. PBS Documentary Featuring Terry Winograd Using SHRDLU
Graham watched a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd demonstrating SHRDLU, an early natural language understanding computer program. This demonstration had a profound effect on him, making him believe that advanced AI was ""a few years at most"" away. Graham was so inspired that he thought all they needed to do was ""teach SHRDLU more words.""

These two influences were so powerful that Graham ultimately decided to reverse-engineer SHRDLU for his undergraduate thesis, calling it a project he ""loved working on."" He even chose ""Artificial Intelligence"" as his degree focus in his flexible Cornell program that didn't require traditional majors.

What particularly interests you about Paul Graham's journey from philosophy to AI?","The two specific influences that led the author to develop an interest in AI were a novel and a documentary.

Based on Paul Graham's essay, I can provide insights about his initial interest in AI and later disillusionment.

### Two Main Influences That Drew Him to AI

Paul Graham was initially drawn to artificial intelligence by two specific influences:

1. **Heinlein's Novel**: ""A novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike."" This science fiction story created a world that Paul was ""drawn entirely into,"" making him believe intelligent computers were an inevitable future development.

2. **PBS Documentary on SHRDLU**: ""A PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU."" Seeing this AI program in action made such an impression on him that he believed we were only ""a few years at most"" away from having intelligent computers. He thought that ""all you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.""

These influences were so compelling that he decided to focus on AI rather than philosophy during his college years. He even reverse-engineered SHRDLU for his undergraduate thesis, which he described as ""already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.""

### His Realization About AI as a ""Hoax""

During his first year of graduate school at Harvard, Graham came to a pivotal realization:

> ""I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that's told 'the dog is sitting on the chair' translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.""

His key insight was that there was an ""unbridgeable gap"" between what these AI programs could do and actually understanding natural language. The fundamental approach at that time—using ""explicit data structures representing concepts""—was inherently limited:

> ""What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset... It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words.""

Graham realized that this entire approach to AI would never lead to truly intelligent machines like Mike from the novel. He saw that while the field was generating plenty of academic papers about ""band-aids"" for this approach, it was fundamentally flawed and ""was never going to get us Mike.""

This realization led him to shift his focus from AI to Lisp programming, which he found fascinating for its own merits independent of its connection to AI research.

Based on the information from Paul Graham's essay, here are the reasons he was drawn to Lisp and how he developed his understanding of it:

### 🔍 Why Paul Graham Was Drawn to Lisp

1. **Elegance and Power**: Graham was attracted to Lisp because of its ""power and elegance that other languages couldn't match"" compared to other programming languages of the time.

2. **Theoretical Origins**: He was fascinated by Lisp's origins as a formal model of computation (an alternative to the Turing machine) rather than just a programming language. He appreciated how John McCarthy had ""discovered"" rather than merely invented Lisp as a minimal set of operators needed to create a language interpreter.

3. **Contrast to Primitive Languages**: When Graham was in college, the commonly used programming languages (like PL/I) were ""pretty primitive."" Learning Lisp ""expanded [his] concept of a program so fast that it was years before [he] started to have a sense of where the new limits were.""

4. **Connection to AI**: Initially, his interest in Lisp came through his interest in artificial intelligence, as ""in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI."" When his AI plans didn't work out, he focused on Lisp itself.

### 📚 How He Furthered His Understanding of Lisp

1. **Writing Books**: Graham wrote multiple books on Lisp:
   - ""On Lisp"" (published in 1993) - He admits: ""It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it.""
   - ""ANSI Common Lisp"" - A more popular book that could be used as a textbook

2. **Professional Work**: He worked at Interleaf, where they had added a dialect of Lisp as a scripting language. He was hired as a Lisp hacker to write programs in it.

3. **Creating His Own Lisp Dialects**: 
   - He created a dialect called ""Arc"" with someone named Dan
   - Later, he spent 4 years (from March 2015 to October 2019) developing ""Bel,"" a new Lisp written in itself that attempted to preserve the ""discoveredness"" quality of McCarthy's original Lisp

4. **Using Lisp in Business**: He used Lisp at Viaweb (his startup), which became the subject of a talk he gave at a Lisp conference

Graham's journey with Lisp spans decades, from his initial encounter in college to creating his own dialects later in life. The language clearly had a profound impact on his thinking and career, serving as both a practical tool for his startups and an intellectual pursuit for its own sake.

Is there any specific aspect of his relationship with Lisp you'd like to explore further?","The author shifted his interest towards Lisp after realizing that the way AI was practiced at the time, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. He found that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, which was the main reason people cared about it at the time. To further his understanding of Lisp, he decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. He mentions that writing a book about something can help you learn it.

Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.\n\nSo now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp.

In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's a whole world there that's barely been explored.

I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\n\nI'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design."", 'In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.', 'For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU.

You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose ""Artificial Intelligence."" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.', ""In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school.

There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.\n\nAnd moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get research funding."", 'There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who ""could draw"" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.\n\nI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor.

# 🎨 Paul Graham's Reconciliation of Computer Science and Art in Grad School

Based on Paul Graham's essay, I can see how he attempted to reconcile his interests in computer science and art during his graduate school years. This was a significant period of personal exploration for him as he navigated between these seemingly disparate fields.

## The Academic Path vs. The Artistic Path

While pursuing his PhD in computer science at Harvard, Graham found himself drawn to art in a profound way. During a visit to the Carnegie Institute (where he had spent time as a kid), he had a revelation:

> ""While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.""

This realization about the enduring nature of art stood in stark contrast to his work in computer science, particularly AI, which he was becoming increasingly disillusioned with.

## His Unconventional Approach in Grad School

Graham took an unusual approach to his graduate studies that allowed him to pursue both interests simultaneously:

> ""That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.""

This led to an interesting situation where he was effectively living a double life:

> ""So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.""

## Finding His Own Path in Both Worlds

While pursuing his PhD, Graham found a way to salvage something from his waning interest in AI - his love for Lisp programming:

> ""So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time.""

This led him to write ""On Lisp,"" a book about Lisp hacking, during his graduate school years.

Simultaneously, he was preparing for a life in art, applying to art schools while finishing his dissertation:

> ""I picked applications of continuations as the topic... But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely. Meanwhile I was applying to art schools.""

## The Tension Between Theory and Practice

In both fields, Graham seemed to gravitate toward the practical, hands-on aspects rather than the theoretical:

> ""Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things.""

Similarly, in art, he identified more with the students who wanted to improve their technical skills rather than those focused on developing a signature style:

> ""There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who 'could draw' in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better... I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.""

## The Resolution

Rather than fully reconciling these interests during grad school, Graham instead used this time to explore both paths before ultimately making a series of transitions - first finishing his PhD, then attending RISD for art, before eventually returning to programming with his startup Viaweb.

His grad school experience represents a period of coexistence rather than true integration of these interests, where he was actively pursuing both while trying to determine his future direction.

Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of Paul Graham's dual interests in more detail?","The author in the essay is Paul Graham, who was pursuing a PhD in computer science but also developed an interest in art. He found himself in a complex situation where he was simultaneously exploring different fields and trying to reconcile his interests.

In terms of computer science, Graham was particularly interested in Lisp, a programming language. He decided to write a book about Lisp hacking, titled ""On Lisp,"" as a way to deepen his understanding of the language. He was also intrigued by the idea of building things that would last, which he felt was a challenge in the field of systems work in computer science as any program written would eventually become obsolete.

On the other hand, Graham also developed a fascination with art. He was inspired by a visit to the Carnegie Institute where he realized that paintings, unlike software, do not become obsolete and can last for hundreds of years. This realization led him to consider the possibility of becoming an artist himself. Despite having no prior experience, he started taking art classes at Harvard while still being in the PhD program.

Graham found himself working on multiple projects that were not related to his thesis. He was writing his book on Lisp, taking art classes, and still trying to complete his PhD. He was in a dilemma about how to reconcile his varied interests and find a way out of grad school.

A turning point came when his professor asked if he was ready to graduate. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham decided to write one in the remaining weeks before the deadline, reusing parts of his book ""On Lisp"" where he could. This decision reflects his attempt to reconcile his interests by integrating his work on Lisp into his academic obligations.",0.9999999999,0.8,0.9059542438128639,0.9767441860465116,0.61,1.0

I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.

Based on the essay, Paul Graham discusses his decision to write a book on Lisp hacking despite his limited knowledge. Here are the key insights about his approach:

### Reasons for Writing a Book on Lisp Despite Limited Knowledge

1. **Learning through teaching**: ""It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it."" This shows Graham's belief that teaching something is one of the best ways to learn it deeply.

2. **Genuine interest in Lisp**: ""I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI."" His intrinsic fascination with the language motivated him to explore it further.

3. **Salvaging from previous plans**: After his AI research plans didn't work out as expected, he looked for what he could salvage, and ""there was Lisp."" He pivoted to focus on what remained interesting to him.

4. **Financial considerations**: Later, when working at Interleaf, he mentions, ""I was nervous about money... So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp."" (He says this somewhat ironically, as writing Lisp books was hardly the path to riches.)

### How This Reflects His Approach to Learning and Problem-Solving

1. **Learning by doing**: Graham consistently puts himself in situations where he has to learn deeply by creating something substantial. He doesn't wait until he's an expert to begin projects.

2. **Following genuine curiosity**: Throughout the essay, he demonstrates following his interests rather than conventional paths. His work on Lisp came from genuine fascination with the language.

3. **Embracing challenges**: Taking on a book project about something he didn't fully understand shows his willingness to dive into challenging situations as learning opportunities.

4. **Long-term commitment**: The book ""On Lisp"" wasn't published until 1993, though he wrote much of it in grad school, showing his willingness to stick with difficult projects over extended periods.

5. **Building instead of just theorizing**: He notes, ""Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things."" This hands-on approach characterizes much of his learning style.

This pattern repeats in his later work on creating new Lisp dialects like Arc and Bel, where he would embark on ambitious projects driven by curiosity rather than existing expertise. His approach consistently shows that he learns through creation and exploration rather than through fully understanding something before starting.

Does this insight into Paul Graham's approach to learning through writing about topics he's still mastering interest you? Is there another aspect of his work or learning philosophy you'd like to explore?","The author decided to write a book on Lisp hacking primarily because he found Lisp interesting in its own right, separate from its association with AI. He also believed that writing a book about something is a good way to learn it. This reflects his approach to learning and problem-solving as being hands-on and experiential. He's not afraid to dive into a subject he's not fully versed in, using the process of writing and explaining to deepen his understanding. This approach suggests a willingness to take risks and learn through doing, rather than relying solely on prior knowledge or expertise.",0.62499999996875,1.0,0.9236082339344577,0.9285714285714286,0.71,1.0

I didn\'t want to drop out of grad school, but how else was I going to get out?

I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn\'t have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay ""Yes, I think so. I\'ll give you something to read in a few days.""', 'We\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\'d all have dinner there once a week — on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays — and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source.

Based on the information from the essay, here's what I found about the author's quick decision regarding his graduation:

### The Decision

In April 1990, Paul Graham ran into Professor Cheatham who asked him if he was far enough along to graduate that June. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham made what he described as ""the quickest bit of thinking in my life"" and decided to attempt writing his dissertation in the approximately 5 weeks that remained before the deadline.

### How He Planned to Execute It

1. He immediately responded to Professor Cheatham with ""Yes, I think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.""

2. He planned to write the dissertation rapidly in just 5 weeks.

3. He would reuse parts of his work ""On Lisp"" where possible.

4. He chose ""applications of continuations"" as his topic (though he later mentions he should have written about macros and embedded languages).

The gamble worked - Graham mentions that his ""rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely"" to complete his graduation requirements. It appears this quick decision was motivated by his desire to get out of grad school, as he had mentioned earlier feeling trapped in his situation.","The author decided to attempt writing his dissertation in the 5 weeks that remained before the deadline, despite not having a single word written yet.

Based on Paul Graham's account, the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence presented quite a different educational environment than he had expected. Here's what he describes about the student-faculty interactions and teaching approaches:

### Atmosphere and Interactions at the Accademia

🏛️ **General Environment**
- Graham describes the Accademia as a ""(very civilized) joke"" with both students and faculty being ""the nicest people you could imagine""
- The institution adhered outwardly to the conventions of a 19th-century atelier, including traditional elements like a wood-burning stove with a nude model posed nearby
- The school had a significant number of foreign students (stranieri), who were required to take an entrance exam which local Italian students did not have to take

### Student-Faculty Relationship

- Graham notes that students and faculty ""had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything""
- He mentions his teacher, Professor Ulivi, as ""a nice guy"" who recognized Graham's hard work and gave him a good grade
- However, he explicitly states that ""the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian""

### Teaching and Learning Approach

- There appears to have been minimal structured instruction or rigorous curriculum
- Traditional artistic practices were present but not necessarily enforced - Graham mentions that despite having a nude model, ""hardly anyone else painted her besides me""
- Other students ""spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art"" rather than engaging in formal study
- The environment seemed to lack the educational rigor Graham had expected from ""the oldest art school""

Graham contrasts this with his later experience at RISD (Rhode Island School of Design), noting that while RISD was ""better organized"" and ""a lot more expensive,"" the painting department there was also ""post-rigorous"" and somewhat similar to the Accademia in its approach.

This portrayal suggests the Accademia operated more as a social artistic environment with traditional trappings rather than as a structured educational institution with a rigorous teaching methodology. The student-faculty dynamic appears to have been cordial but educationally undemanding by Graham's assessment.","According to the author's account, the students and faculty at the Accademia di Belli Arti had an arrangement where the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.

8,"In the essay, the author discusses his experience with painting still lives. Based on his description, explain how the process of painting a still life differs from painting a person. What does the author suggest is the benefit of painting still lives in terms of visual perception?","['I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren\'t consciously aware of much we\'re seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain ""that\'s a water droplet"" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or ""that\'s a bush"" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there\'s a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.\n\nThis is not the only way to paint. I\'m not 100% sure it\'s even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.', ""While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the"", 'edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. [4]', ""[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price."", ""In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.\n\nAnd moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get research funding."", ""When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was rich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented with a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet)."", ""What should I do next?

Based on Paul Graham's essay, here's how painting a still life differs from painting a person, and the benefits he found in still life painting:

## Differences Between Painting Still Lives vs. People

### Movement and Time
- **Still Lives**: As the name suggests, objects in a still life don't move. This allows the painter to observe them for extended periods without change.
- **People**: Graham notes that people ""can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still."" This significant difference affects the entire approach to painting.

### Approach to Painting
- **Still Lives**: Can be copied ""pixel by pixel"" from what the artist sees, allowing for meticulous observation and reproduction.
- **People**: Requires knowing how to paint ""a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting."" This is more of a template-based approach necessitated by the subject's movement.

### Observation Time
- **Still Lives**: Allow for extended, uninterrupted observation (days), enabling deeper perception.
- **People**: Limited sitting time forces a different technique with less direct observation.

## Benefits of Painting Still Lives for Visual Perception

Graham suggests several important benefits:

1. **Enhanced Visual Awareness**: ""In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing."" Still life painting forces you to look more closely at things we normally take for granted.

2. **Bypassing Mental Shortcuts**: Graham explains that normal visual perception is handled by ""low-level processes that merely tell your brain 'that's a water droplet' without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are."" Painting still lives requires overriding these shortcuts.

3. **Discovering Hidden Complexity**: ""When you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see."" He notes you can still be ""noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted.""

4. **Beyond Photographic Accuracy**: By emphasizing visual cues like the edge of an object where color changes, Graham suggests still life painters can create ""paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.""

Graham does mention that you can paint people like still lives ""if you want to, and they're willing,"" though ""the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters."" He considers this type of portrait ""arguably the apex of still life painting.""

What aspects of Paul Graham's experience with painting are you most interested in learning more about?","In the essay, the author explains that painting a still life is different from painting a person because the subject of a still life doesn't move, unlike a person who can't sit still for more than about 15 minutes. When painting people, the traditional method is to know how to paint a generic person, which is then modified to match the specific person being painted. In contrast, a still life can be copied pixel by pixel from what the artist is seeing.

The author suggests that painting still lives allows for a deeper understanding of visual perception. In everyday life, much of what we see is processed by low-level brain functions that provide a general understanding of what we're seeing, without detailing every aspect. However, when painting a still life, the artist must look more closely and notice details that are usually overlooked. The author notes that this process of careful observation can lead to new discoveries even after days of painting something that people usually take for granted. Therefore, painting still lives can enhance visual perception by encouraging a more detailed and conscious observation of the world.",0.99999999995,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.83,1.0
9,"The author shares his work experience at a company called Interleaf. Describe the unique feature that Interleaf had added to their software and its significance. Also, discuss the author's role in the company and his self-assessment of his performance.","[""Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish."", ""I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)\n\nThe best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant."", ""I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it."", ""Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.\n\nI wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]"", 'But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it\'s good to be the ""entry level"" option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you\'re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.\n\nWhen I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.', ""The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\n\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]"", ""I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]"", 'Hmph. Well, I\'d do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it\'s now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn\'t so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we\'d hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.\n\nBy then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an ""application service provider,"" or ASP. This name didn\'t last long before it was replaced by ""software as a service,"" but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.', 'I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I\'d never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. When you\'re working on an interpreter written in itself, it\'s hard to keep track of what\'s happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.\n\nSo I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I\'d ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I\'d check Twitter or HN and see someone asking ""Does Paul Graham still code?""', ""This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.""]","

## Paul Graham's Experience at Interleaf

Based on the information, I can provide details about Paul Graham's experience at Interleaf, the unique software feature, and his self-assessment.

### The Unique Feature and Its Significance

✨ **Innovative Software Feature:**
Interleaf had added a scripting language to their document creation software, which was particularly notable because:
- It was inspired by Emacs
- The scripting language was actually a dialect of Lisp
- This was considered a ""bold"" move for a document creation software company

This feature was significant because it represented an attempt to add programming flexibility to document software, allowing for customization and automation. The addition of a Lisp dialect was particularly remarkable as Lisp was (and remains) a language favored by certain programmers for its powerful capabilities, but wasn't commonly integrated into commercial document software.

### Paul Graham's Role and Self-Assessment

🔹 **Role at Interleaf:**
- He was hired specifically as a ""Lisp hacker"" to write things using their Lisp scripting language
- This was described as ""the closest thing [he's] had to a normal job""
- Later, he arranged to do freelance work for the customer projects group

🔹 **Self-Assessment of His Performance:**
Graham is quite candid and critical about his own performance at Interleaf:
1. ""I was a bad employee"" (his direct words)
2. He admits he was ""terribly irresponsible""
3. He struggled with the traditional office hours, which ""seemed unnatural"" to him
4. He confesses that toward the end of his time there, he spent ""much of [his] time surreptitiously working"" on his book ""On Lisp""
5. He never fully understood most of the software because Lisp was ""the thinnest icing on a giant C cake"" and he ""didn't know C and didn't want to learn it""

### Lessons Learned at Interleaf

Despite his self-described poor performance, Graham notes that he ""learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do,"" including:
- Technology companies are better run by product people than sales people
- Too many people editing code leads to bugs
- Cheap office space is ""no bargain if it's depressing""
- Planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations
- Big, bureaucratic customers are ""a dangerous source of money""
- Traditional office hours and locations aren't optimal for programming/hacking

The experience at Interleaf, while not his most successful professional engagement by his own admission, provided valuable insights that influenced his future ventures, including Viaweb and Y Combinator.

What aspects of Paul Graham's Interleaf experience would you like to explore further?","Interleaf, the company where the author worked, had added a unique feature to their software. Inspired by Emacs, they incorporated a scripting language into their software, which was even made as a dialect of Lisp. This bold move was significant as it allowed for more complex and flexible operations within the software.

The author's role in the company was to write things in this scripting language, essentially functioning as a Lisp hacker. However, the author self-assesses his performance as poor. He admits to being a bad employee, stating that he didn't understand most of the software because their Lisp was just a thin layer on top of a large amount of C code, a language he didn't know and didn't want to learn. Additionally, he confesses to being terribly irresponsible, particularly in relation to the traditional working hours that were expected at the time.",0.9999999999,0.8571428571428571,0.0,0.8666666666666667,0.48,1.0
