I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book.

I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.', 'What I Worked On\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called ""data processing."" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it.

The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much.

The first computer Paul Graham used for programming was a TRS-80, which he acquired around 1980 after convincing his father to purchase it. Although the Apple II was the gold standard at that time, the TRS-80 was adequate for his needs. On this computer, he wrote simple games, a rocket flight prediction program, and even a word processor used by his father to write a book.

### Programming Language
Initially, Graham used an early version of Fortran, which involved typing programs on punch cards and using a card reader to load them into the machine. He also mentions using Lisp during his endeavors in artificial intelligence, noting its power and elegance.

### Challenges Faced
One of the significant challenges he faced was the limitation of computer memory, which restricted his word processor to handle only about two pages of text at a time. Additionally, working with punch cards was cumbersome and facilitated limited programming experience. The transition from processing data with punch cards to microcomputers marked a significant improvement, allowing what he describes as a more interactive programming experience.","The first computer the author used for programming was the IBM 1401, which was used by his school district for data processing. He started using it in 9th grade, around the age of 13 or 14. The programming language he used was an early version of Fortran. The author faced several challenges while using this computer.

Two specific influences led Paul Graham to develop an interest in AI during his college years:

1. **The Novel ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" by Robert Heinlein**: This book featured an intelligent computer named Mike, which captivated Graham's imagination. The depiction of an AI with advanced capabilities seemed within reach and sparked Graham's interest in pursuing AI as a field of study.

2. **Terry Winograd's SHRDLU**: A PBS documentary showcasing Terry Winograd's work with SHRDLU, an early natural language processing program, also influenced Graham. It demonstrated the potential of AI, making the idea of creating intelligent systems seem tangible and inspiring him to explore AI further.","The two specific influences that led the author to develop an interest in AI were a novel and a documentary.

2. A PBS documentary showcasing Terry Winograd's use of SHRDLU, a program for language understanding.

These influences led him to believe that creating an intelligent computer was imminent.

Paul Graham's shift of interest towards Lisp was influenced by several factors:

1. **Core Philosophy of Lisp**: He appreciated Lisp's origins as a formal model of computation rather than just a programming language. This foundational approach, established by John McCarthy, emphasized its core as a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself.

2. **Elegance and Power**: Lisp's origins as a model of computation endowed it with unique elegance and power, which Graham found compelling even though he didn't fully understand it during college.

3. **Language of AI**: At the time, Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. This association with AI piqued Graham's interest, leading him to teach himself Lisp.

4. **Freedom in Development**: His interest grew as he discovered he could develop a new Lisp dialect, Arc, which provided a degree of creative freedom. He saw Lisp as interesting in its own right and decided to focus on its development.

5. **Self-Education and Writing**: Graham furthered his understanding by writing about Lisp, which included authoring books such as ""On Lisp"" and working on new Lisp dialects like Bel, completed as a specification expressed in code.

These elements combined to foster Graham's enduring interest in Lisp, and he applied this passion to practical projects, such as developing Arc and publishing significant works about Lisp programming.","The author shifted his interest towards Lisp after realizing that the way AI was practiced at the time, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. He found that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, which was the main reason people cared about it at the time. To further his understanding of Lisp, he decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. He mentions that writing a book about something can help you learn it. The book he wrote, ""On Lisp,"" was mostly written during his time in grad school.",0.2916666666520833,0.8,0.920801765347884,1.0,0.33,0.25

During his time in grad school, Paul Graham made significant efforts to reconcile his interests in computer science and art. Here are some specific examples from his essay:

- **Art Classes at Harvard**: Despite being enrolled in a PhD program in computer science, Graham took advantage of the opportunity to attend art classes at Harvard. This was possible because Tom Cheatham, his advisor, was flexible and allowed him to explore subjects outside his primary field of study.

- **Love for Lisp and Artwork**: Graham maintained a dual focus by working on Lisp programming while also planning to pursue a career in art. He was deeply involved in both writing ""On Lisp"" and preparing to become an artist, demonstrating his commitment to both fields.

- **Applying to Art Schools**: As he neared the completion of his graduate studies, Graham applied to the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence. He was accepted at RISD, which led him to pursue formal education in art.

- **Experiences at RISD**: At RISD, though initially required to take foundational courses in art, Graham realized that the educational approach in painting was less rigorous compared to other fields. This insight led him to self-guide his learning process in painting while remaining engaged with computer science.

These actions underscore how Graham actively sought to weave his dual passions for computer science and art throughout his graduate education. Would you like to explore how his approach influenced his later career choices?","The author in the essay is Paul Graham, who was pursuing a PhD in computer science but also developed an interest in art. He found himself in a complex situation where he was simultaneously exploring different fields and trying to reconcile his interests.

In terms of computer science, Graham was particularly interested in Lisp, a programming language. He decided to write a book about Lisp hacking, titled ""On Lisp,"" as a way to deepen his understanding of the language. He was also intrigued by the idea of building things that would last, which he felt was a challenge in the field of systems work in computer science as any program written would eventually become obsolete.

On the other hand, Graham also developed a fascination with art. He was inspired by a visit to the Carnegie Institute where he realized that paintings, unlike software, do not become obsolete and can last for hundreds of years. This realization led him to consider the possibility of becoming an artist himself. Despite having no prior experience, he started taking art classes at Harvard while still being in the PhD program.

Graham found himself working on multiple projects that were not related to his thesis. He was writing his book on Lisp, taking art classes, and still trying to complete his PhD. He was in a dilemma about how to reconcile his varied interests and find a way out of grad school.

A turning point came when his professor asked if he was ready to graduate. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham decided to write one in the remaining weeks before the deadline, reusing parts of his book ""On Lisp"" where he could. This decision reflects his attempt to reconcile his interests by integrating his work on Lisp into his academic obligations.",0.9999999999,1.0,0.905331458376147,0.9411764705882353,0.36,1.0

A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\n\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]"", ""I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)\n\nThe best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant."", ""I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]"", ""Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish."", ""Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.\n\nI wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work.

At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we\'d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores — in Lisp, of course.', ""McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it.

Paul Graham decided to write a book on Lisp hacking, titled ""On Lisp,"" despite having limited initial knowledge about it. Here are the key reasons and reflections on his approach to learning and problem-solving:

- **Focus on Lisp:** Graham chose to focus on Lisp because he found it inherently interesting. This decision wasn't just based on its association with AI but rather on its own merits.

- **Learning Through Writing:** He recognized the value of writing a book as a method to deepen his understanding of Lisp. The act of writing forced him to learn more about the subject matter, reflecting his proactive and immersive approach to learning.

- **Building Over Theory:** Although he respected theoretical aspects of computer science, Graham was more interested in building things. This preference aligns with his initiative to write about Lisp, a language known for enabling creative problem-solving through its flexible and expressive syntax.

Graham's decision exemplifies his willingness to engage deeply with subjects he finds intriguing, leveraging challenges as opportunities for learning and exploration. Would you like to know more about how this experience influenced his later work?","The author decided to write a book on Lisp hacking primarily because he found Lisp interesting in its own right, separate from its association with AI. He also believed that writing a book about something is a good way to learn it. This reflects his approach to learning and problem-solving as being hands-on and experiential. He's not afraid to dive into a subject he's not fully versed in, using the process of writing and explaining to deepen his understanding.

In the essay, Paul Graham describes a sudden decision he made regarding his graduation.

Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine.

The atmosphere at the Accademia di Belli Arti, as described by Paul Graham, was characterized by cordial interactions between students and faculty. However, there was an unspoken agreement that neither party would push the other too hard—students didn't press the faculty to teach, and faculty didn't demand much learning from students. This approach resulted in a somewhat relaxed and traditional environment, adhering formally to the conventions of a 19th-century atelier, complete with period-appropriate features like a stove and a nude model. However, serious effort in painting was minimal. Most students preferred chatting or mimicking art styles they admired rather than engaging deeply with their craft.

This interaction was representative of a more leisurely approach to learning and teaching, focusing more on maintaining appearance than rigorous educational progression.

What does the author suggest is the benefit of painting still lives in terms of visual perception?","[""While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the"", 'I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren\'t consciously aware of much we\'re seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain ""that\'s a water droplet"" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or ""that\'s a bush"" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there\'s a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.\n\nThis is not the only way to paint. I\'m not 100% sure it\'s even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.', ""[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law.

Painting a still life, as opposed to a person, offers unique advantages and challenges. Here’s how Paul Graham describes the differences and benefits:

### Process Differences:
- **Movement**: Still lives, as the name implies, do not move, allowing the artist to have an uninterrupted focus on the subject. People, however, can only sit still briefly, necessitating the artist to often rely on generic forms to adapt when painting people.
- **Accuracy**: With still lives, there's the possibility to meticulously copy the scene as it appears, allowing for more detailed replication. This differs from people painting, where some creativity might be required to depict the pose or expression accurately.

### Benefits to Visual Perception:
- **Attention to Detail**: The lack of movement in still lives encourages deeper observation. Graham notes that this leads to noticing new details daily as one paints, thus enhancing one's visual perception.
- **Enhanced Realism**: Since you have time to observe and emphasize visual cues, such as subtle color changes, paintings can become more realistic than photographs in their information depth.
  
Through this process, painting still lives assists artists in engaging more deeply with the visual nuances of the world, fostering a profound appreciation and comprehension of simple details often overlooked in everyday life. Would you like to explore anything else from the essay?","In the essay, the author explains that painting a still life is different from painting a person because the subject of a still life doesn't move, unlike a person who can't sit still for more than about 15 minutes. When painting people, the traditional method is to know how to paint a generic person, which is then modified to match the specific person being painted. In contrast, a still life can be copied pixel by pixel from what the artist is seeing.

The author suggests that painting still lives allows for a deeper understanding of visual perception. In everyday life, much of what we see is processed by low-level brain functions that provide a general understanding of what we're seeing, without detailing every aspect. However, when painting a still life, the artist must look more closely and notice details that are usually overlooked. The author notes that this process of careful observation can lead to new discoveries even after days of painting something that people usually take for granted. Therefore, painting still lives can enhance visual perception by encouraging a more detailed and conscious observation of the world.",0.99999999995,1.0,0.895904637035103,0.8181818181818182,0.75,1.0

**Unique Feature of Interleaf's Software:**
Interleaf implemented a bold feature inspired by Emacs: they added a scripting language, which was a dialect of Lisp, into their software. This addition allowed more programmable manipulation of documents and provided a powerful tool for users who understood Lisp, contributing to the software's flexibility and extendability.

**Author's Role and Performance at Interleaf:**
Paul Graham was hired at Interleaf to leverage his Lisp skills, but he acknowledged that he was a \""bad employee\"": 
- The Lisp addition was minor compared to the dominant C codebase, a language Graham was not familiar with and reluctant to learn.
- He felt disconnected from traditional office norms, such as rigid work hours, which led to friction with management.
- During his time there, he became distracted by writing a book on Lisp, spending considerable time on this personal project while at work.

This reflective self-assessment highlights a mismatch between his skills and the company's technological stack, along with his difficulties in adjusting to conventional work environments.
