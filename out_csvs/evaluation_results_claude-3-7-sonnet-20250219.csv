## First Computer Experience

Paul Graham's first programming experience was on an IBM 1401 computer that was located in the basement of his junior high school. This happened when he was 13 or 14 years old (in 9th grade). The school district used this machine for ""data processing,"" and Paul and his friend Rich Draves got permission to use it. He described the computer room as ""like a mini Bond villain's lair"" with ""alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.""

## Programming Language

For this first computer, Graham used an early version of Fortran. Programs had to be typed on punch cards, which were then stacked in the card reader. Pressing a button would load the program into memory and run it, with results typically being printed on what he described as a ""spectacularly loud printer.""

## Challenges He Faced

Graham faced several significant challenges with this early programming experience:

1. **Limited Input Options**: He was puzzled about what to do with the IBM 1401 because the only input method was data stored on punched cards, which he didn't have.

2. **Limited Programming Options**: Without input data, his options were restricted to programs that didn't rely on any input (like calculating approximations of pi), but he ""didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type.""

3. **Infinite Loops**: He discovered the concept of non-terminating programs when one of his programs didn't terminate. This was both a technical and social error in an environment without time-sharing, as made clear by ""the data center manager's expression.""

4. **Limited Productivity**: Graham mentions that he can't remember any programs he wrote on the 1401 because ""they can't have done much"" given these limitations.

Later, around 1980, after ""years of nagging,"" his father bought him a TRS-80 computer. This is when he ""really started programming,"" creating simple games, a program to predict how high his model rockets would fly, and a word processor that his father used to write at least one book - though it could only handle about 2 pages of text in memory at a time.

## Two Key Influences on Paul Graham's AI Interest

### 1. Heinlein's Novel ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress""
This science fiction novel featured an intelligent computer named Mike. Graham describes being ""drawn entirely into its world"" and believed it was ""only a matter of time before we'd have Mike."" The portrayal of artificial intelligence in this literary work sparked his imagination about the possibilities of AI.

### 2. PBS Documentary Featuring Terry Winograd Using SHRDLU
Graham watched a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd demonstrating SHRDLU, an early natural language understanding computer program. This real-world demonstration had a profound impact on Graham, making him believe that advanced AI was within reach - ""it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.""

These two influences were so compelling that Graham eventually reverse-engineered SHRDLU for his undergraduate thesis, which he describes working on with great enthusiasm: ""My God did I love working on that program."" He believed at the time (around 1985) that it was ""already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.""

Interestingly, Graham later became disillusioned with AI during his first year of graduate school, realizing that ""AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax."" This led him to shift his focus to Lisp programming instead.

Is there anything specific about these influences or Graham's AI journey that you'd like to explore further?","The two specific influences that led the author to develop an interest in AI were a novel and a documentary. The novel was ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" by Heinlein, which featured an intelligent computer named Mike. The author was drawn into the world of the novel and felt it was only a matter of time before we'd have an intelligent computer like Mike. The documentary was a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU, a computer program that used natural language processing. Seeing Winograd use SHRDLU made the author believe that the development of AI was imminent.",0.19999999998,1.0,0.918626720374324,0.8095238095238095,0.63,1.0

## Paul Graham's Initial Interest in AI

According to the essay, two main influences drew Graham to AI:

1. **Heinlein's Novel**: A novel by Robert Heinlein called ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,"" which featured an intelligent computer named Mike. Graham mentions being ""drawn entirely into its world"" and believed it was ""only a matter of time before we'd have Mike.""

2. **PBS Documentary on SHRDLU**: Graham was strongly influenced by watching a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU (an early natural language understanding computer program). After seeing this demonstration, Graham thought that creating true AI ""seemed like that time would be a few years at most"" and that ""all you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.""

## His Disillusionment with AI

Graham's realization that led him to view contemporary AI approaches as a ""hoax"" came during his first year of graduate school at Harvard. While he doesn't recall a specific moment when this realization struck, he came to understand that AI as practiced at that time was fundamentally flawed.

Specifically, he recognized the limitations in the approach where programs would translate statements like ""the dog is sitting on the chair"" into formal representations that would be added to a knowledge base. He realized that:

> ""What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language.""

Graham concluded that ""it was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words"" and that ""that whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work"" to create truly intelligent systems like the fictional Mike from Heinlein's novel.

After this disillusionment, he decided to salvage Lisp programming from his AI ambitions and focus on it instead, eventually writing a book called ""On Lisp.""","The two main influences that initially drew the author to AI were a novel by Heinlein called ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,"" which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. The realization that led him to believe that the approach to AI during his time was a hoax was that the AI programs of the time, which translated natural language into formal representations and added them to their knowledge base, were not truly understanding natural language.

## Paul Graham's Journey with Lisp

### Why He Became Interested in Lisp

1. **AI Connection**: Graham initially encountered Lisp when trying to teach himself artificial intelligence in college. As he notes, ""in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.""

2. **Conceptual Expansion**: Compared to other programming languages of the time (like PL/I and Pascal), Lisp dramatically expanded his concept of what programming could be:
   > ""Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were.""

3. **Power and Elegance**: He was attracted to Lisp's unique qualities that stemmed from its origins as a model of computation:
   > ""Its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time.""

4. **Mathematical Foundation**: Graham appreciated that Lisp wasn't originally intended as a programming language but as ""a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine"" - this theoretical foundation gave it special properties.

### How He Furthered His Understanding of Lisp

1. **Writing Books**: He wrote multiple books on Lisp which deepened his knowledge:
   - ""On Lisp"" (started in grad school, published in 1993)
   - ""ANSI Common Lisp"" (which also features his painting on the cover)
   > ""There's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it.""

2. **Professional Work**: He used Lisp professionally at Viaweb, a startup he co-founded, and later gave talks about this experience at Lisp conferences.

3. **Creating New Lisp Dialects**: Graham worked on developing his own Lisp dialects:
   - Arc: A new dialect he developed with Dan after selling Viaweb
   - Bel: A project he worked on for four years (2015-2019), trying to create a Lisp that preserved John McCarthy's original ""discovered"" quality

4. **Deep Theoretical Exploration**: His work on Bel shows his deep dive into Lisp's theoretical foundations, as he tried to extend McCarthy's axiomatic approach:
   > ""Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on.""

Graham's journey with Lisp spans decades, from his initial encounter in college to creating his own dialects, showing how this language became a significant thread throughout his career.

Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of his relationship with Lisp in more detail?","The author shifted his interest towards Lisp after realizing that the way AI was practiced at the time, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. He found that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, which was the main reason people cared about it at the time. To further his understanding of Lisp, he decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. He mentions that writing a book about something can help you learn it. The book he wrote, ""On Lisp,"" was mostly written during his time in grad school.",0.33333333331666665,0.8,0.9149408847339924,1.0,0.0,0.5

I knew intellectually that people made art — that it didn't just appear spontaneously — but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.\n\nThat fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.\n\nSo now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis."", ""I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's a whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.\n\nMeanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\n\nI'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design."", 'In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.', 'There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who ""could draw"" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.\n\nI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn\'t much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]', ""In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.\n\nAnd moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get research funding."", 'For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU.

You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose ""Artificial Intelligence.""

Looking at Paul Graham's essay, we can see his attempt to reconcile his dual passions for computer science and art during his graduate studies. This tension between his technical and artistic sides created an interesting dynamic in his academic journey.

### The Awakening of Artistic Interest

While pursuing his PhD in computer science at Harvard, Graham had a realization during a visit to the Carnegie Institute around 1988:

> ""While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.""

This insight marked a significant shift in his thinking. As someone working in computer science, where technologies quickly became outdated, the permanence of art appealed to him deeply.

### Parallel Pursuits in Graduate School

Graham explicitly describes his divided attention during his PhD program:

> ""That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.""

This led to a multifaceted academic identity:

> ""So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.""

### Disillusionment with AI and Pivot to Lisp

An important part of this period was his disillusionment with artificial intelligence:

> ""I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax.""

This realization pushed him to focus more on Lisp programming, which became a bridge between his technical abilities and creative interests:

> ""So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI.""

### From Computer Science PhD to Art School

Graham's commitment to pursuing art led him to apply to art schools while finishing his dissertation:

> ""I picked applications of continuations as the topic... But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely. Meanwhile I was applying to art schools.""

He was accepted to RISD (Rhode Island School of Design) and actually enrolled there after completing his PhD, showing the seriousness of his commitment to art.

### The Marriage of Technical and Artistic Work

Perhaps the most symbolic reconciliation of his dual interests came through his book on Lisp programming:

> ""I decided to write another book on Lisp... The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.""

By featuring his own artwork on the cover of a technical programming book, Graham literally combined his two passions into a single artifact.

Graham's journey shows how he didn't simply choose between his interests but found ways to pursue both simultaneously, even when it meant taking an unconventional academic path. His experience reflects the challenge many multi-talented individuals face when their passions span traditionally separate disciplines.

Would you like me to explore any specific aspect of Graham's dual interests in greater detail?","The author in the essay is Paul Graham, who was pursuing a PhD in computer science but also developed an interest in art. He found himself in a complex situation where he was simultaneously exploring different fields and trying to reconcile his interests.

In terms of computer science, Graham was particularly interested in Lisp, a programming language. He decided to write a book about Lisp hacking, titled ""On Lisp,"" as a way to deepen his understanding of the language. He was also intrigued by the idea of building things that would last, which he felt was a challenge in the field of systems work in computer science as any program written would eventually become obsolete.

On the other hand, Graham also developed a fascination with art. He was inspired by a visit to the Carnegie Institute where he realized that paintings, unlike software, do not become obsolete and can last for hundreds of years. This realization led him to consider the possibility of becoming an artist himself. Despite having no prior experience, he started taking art classes at Harvard while still being in the PhD program.

Graham found himself working on multiple projects that were not related to his thesis. He was writing his book on Lisp, taking art classes, and still trying to complete his PhD. He was in a dilemma about how to reconcile his varied interests and find a way out of grad school.

A turning point came when his professor asked if he was ready to graduate. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham decided to write one in the remaining weeks before the deadline, reusing parts of his book ""On Lisp"" where he could. This decision reflects his attempt to reconcile his interests by integrating his work on Lisp into his academic obligations.",0.9999999999,0.8,0.851881074352057,0.9354838709677419,0.38,1.0

Graham explicitly acknowledges his limited knowledge when he began writing his book ""On Lisp"":

> ""It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it.""

This statement reveals his belief that the act of teaching (in this case, writing a book) is one of the most effective ways to master a subject.

### Genuine Fascination with Lisp
Graham was attracted to Lisp for its inherent qualities:

> ""I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time.""

He recognized something special in Lisp's design, independent of its popular applications.

### Practical Necessity
After his plans for AI research didn't work out as expected, he looked for something to salvage:

> ""So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp.""

Later, financial concerns also motivated his second Lisp book:

> ""I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare... So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.""

## 🧠 How This Reflects His Approach to Learning and Problem-Solving

### Learning by Doing
Graham's approach shows that he values practical engagement over theoretical understanding before beginning. He didn't wait until he was an expert to write a book - he used the writing process itself as a learning mechanism.

### Following Curiosity
Throughout the passages, we see Graham following his intellectual curiosity rather than conventional paths:

> ""I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp.""

His willingness to follow his interests, even when they seemed contradictory or impractical, is a consistent pattern.

### Persistence with Complex Problems
Graham describes his later work on a Lisp dialect called Bel:

> ""For years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I'd ever worked on anything.""

This shows his commitment to deep, difficult problems that require sustained effort, even when progress isn't visible to others.

### Discovering Rather Than Inventing
Graham's view of Lisp as something that was ""discovered"" rather than invented shows his philosophical approach to problem-solving:

> ""The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question.""

He values understanding the fundamental nature of things rather than just their surface-level utility.

Graham's approach to writing a book on Lisp despite limited knowledge reflects a broader life philosophy: dive in, learn by doing, follow genuine interests, and tackle hard problems for their intrinsic value rather than external validation.

Would you like me to explore any specific aspect of his learning approach in more detail?","The author decided to write a book on Lisp hacking primarily because he found Lisp interesting in its own right, separate from its association with AI. He also believed that writing a book about something is a good way to learn it. This reflects his approach to learning and problem-solving as being hands-on and experiential. He's not afraid to dive into a subject he's not fully versed in, using the process of writing and explaining to deepen his understanding. This approach suggests a willingness to take risks and learn through doing, rather than relying solely on prior knowledge or expertise.",0.62499999996875,1.0,0.9242794630002003,0.84,0.59,1.0
6,"In the essay, the author mentions a quick decision he made regarding his graduation. What was the decision and how did he plan to execute it?","['I didn\'t see a way out of this situation. I didn\'t want to drop out of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he\'d found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.\n\nThen one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn\'t have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay ""Yes, I think so. I\'ll give you something to read in a few days.""', 'We\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\'d all have dinner there once a week — on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays — and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.', ""We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs."", ""When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)"", ""In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners."", ""As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged. Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd been talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and work for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too. [13]\n\nOnce again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices, and some of the things we did turned out to be novel."", ""I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's a whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.\n\nMeanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\n\nI'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages.

It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink. So while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly refused to work on it."", 'I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I\'d visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who\'d invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone.

By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that\'s told ""the dog is sitting on the chair"" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.', 'The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.']","Based on the essay, I found information about Paul Graham's quick decision regarding his graduation:

During his time in graduate school, Paul Graham was feeling stuck and wanting to find a way out. In April 1990, a chance conversation with Professor Cheatham presented an opportunity when the professor asked if Graham was far enough along to graduate that June.

Despite not having written a word of his dissertation at that point, Graham made what he describes as ""the quickest bit of thinking in my life"" and decided to take a shot at writing his dissertation in just 5 weeks before the deadline. He responded to Professor Cheatham without hesitation: ""Yes, I think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.""

To execute this plan, Graham decided to write on ""applications of continuations"" as his dissertation topic and reused parts of his work ""On Lisp"" where possible. He later reflected that this rapidly written dissertation ""sufficed, just barely"" to help him graduate and move on from grad school. In retrospect, he mentioned he should have written about macros and embedded languages instead, but his primary goal was simply to get out of graduate school.

After graduating, Graham applied to art schools, with RISD accepting him, which led to the next phase of his journey.

## The Accademia Experience

### Teaching and Learning Approach
Paul Graham describes the Accademia di Belli Arti as a ""(very civilized) joke"" where a mutual arrangement existed between students and faculty:

- **Informal Agreement**: ""The students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.""
- **Lack of Rigor**: Despite being the oldest art school (which led Graham to believe it would be good), the educational approach was ""post-rigorous,"" especially compared to other disciplines.
- **Traditional Appearance**: They maintained the outward conventions of a 19th-century atelier, complete with ""one of those little stoves, fed with kindling"" and ""a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned.""

### Faculty-Student Interactions
The relationships were characterized by:

- **Warmth but Limited Instruction**: ""The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,"" but substantive teaching was minimal.
- **Personal Attention**: His teacher, Professor Ulivi, is described as ""a nice guy"" who recognized Graham's hard work and gave him good grades, which were recorded in ""a sort of passport each student had.""

### Student Culture and Activities
The student experience was notably relaxed:

- **Limited Engagement**: ""Hardly anyone else painted [the model] besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art.""
- **International Presence**: There were many ""stranieri"" (foreigners) attracted to studying art in Florence, to the point where entrance exams for foreigners may have been a way to limit their numbers.

### Overall Assessment
Graham's ultimate conclusion was that the Accademia ""wasn't teaching me anything except Italian,"" leading him to return to the US after his first year when his money was running out. He later compares it to RISD (Rhode Island School of Design), noting that RISD was ""Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine.""

This experience was part of a pattern in Graham's life where he would ""attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject"" only to be disappointed by the reality of the education provided.","According to the author's account, the students and faculty at the Accademia di Belli Arti had an arrangement where the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.

8,"In the essay, the author discusses his experience with painting still lives. Based on his description, explain how the process of painting a still life differs from painting a person. What does the author suggest is the benefit of painting still lives in terms of visual perception?","['I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren\'t consciously aware of much we\'re seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain ""that\'s a water droplet"" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or ""that\'s a bush"" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there\'s a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.\n\nThis is not the only way to paint. I\'m not 100% sure it\'s even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.', ""While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the"", 'edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. [4]', ""[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about.

## 📝 Painting Still Lives vs. Painting People

### Key Differences

1. **Subject Movement:**
   - **Still Lives**: As the name suggests, objects don't move. Graham notes that ""the subject, as its name suggests, can't move.""
   - **People**: Cannot sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and even then ""they don't sit very still.""

2. **Approach to Painting:**
   - **Still Lives**: Can be copied ""pixel by pixel"" from what you're seeing if you want.
   - **People**: Requires knowing ""how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting.""

3. **Time Factor:**
   - **Still Lives**: Can be studied for extended periods without change.
   - **People**: Limited sitting time leads to practical constraints and often ""pained expressions in the sitters.""

4. **Observation Method:**
   - **Still Lives**: Allows for deep, extended observation of visual details.
   - **People**: Often requires working from a generic understanding of human anatomy with quicker observations.

## 👁️ Benefits for Visual Perception

Graham specifically highlights how painting still lives enhanced his visual perception:

> ""I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing.""

He explains that normal visual perception involves ""low-level processes"" that simply identify objects without noticing details:
- Your brain typically just registers ""that's a water droplet"" without noting the lightest and darkest points
- Or identifies ""that's a bush"" without processing the shape and position of every leaf

### The Perceptual Benefit

When painting a still life, Graham discovered:

1. **Deeper Visual Awareness**: ""When you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see.""

2. **Ongoing Discovery**: ""You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted.""

3. **Enhanced Realism**: By emphasizing visual cues like the edge of an object where color changes suddenly, Graham suggests you can ""make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.""

The process forces a level of observation and understanding that bypasses our brain's natural tendency to simplify visual information, revealing the rich complexity of what we normally overlook.

What interests you most about Paul Graham's approach to painting or visual perception?","In the essay, the author explains that painting a still life is different from painting a person because the subject of a still life doesn't move, unlike a person who can't sit still for more than about 15 minutes. When painting people, the traditional method is to know how to paint a generic person, which is then modified to match the specific person being painted. In contrast, a still life can be copied pixel by pixel from what the artist is seeing.

The author suggests that painting still lives allows for a deeper understanding of visual perception. In everyday life, much of what we see is processed by low-level brain functions that provide a general understanding of what we're seeing, without detailing every aspect. However, when painting a still life, the artist must look more closely and notice details that are usually overlooked. The author notes that this process of careful observation can lead to new discoveries even after days of painting something that people usually take for granted. Therefore, painting still lives can enhance visual perception by encouraging a more detailed and conscious observation of the world.",0.99999999995,1.0,0.9042889671215963,1.0,0.9,1.0
9,"The author shares his work experience at a company called Interleaf. Describe the unique feature that Interleaf had added to their software and its significance. Also, discuss the author's role in the company and his self-assessment of his performance.","[""Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish."", ""I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)\n\nThe best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant."", ""I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it."", ""Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.\n\nI wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]"", 'But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it\'s good to be the ""entry level"" option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you\'re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.\n\nWhen I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.', ""The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\n\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]"", ""I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]"", 'Hmph. Well, I\'d do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it\'s now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn\'t so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we\'d hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.\n\nBy then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an ""application service provider,"" or ASP. This name didn\'t last long before it was replaced by ""software as a service,"" but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.', 'I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I\'d never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. When you\'re working on an interpreter written in itself, it\'s hard to keep track of what\'s happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.\n\nSo I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I\'d ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I\'d check Twitter or HN and see someone asking ""Does Paul Graham still code?""', ""This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.""]","Based on my research, here's what I found about Paul Graham's experience at Interleaf:

## Unique Software Feature at Interleaf

Interleaf had implemented something quite innovative in their document creation software. Inspired by Emacs, they had added a scripting language to their product, and notably, this scripting language was a dialect of Lisp. This was a bold move for a document creation software company at the time.

However, this Lisp implementation was described by Graham as ""the thinnest icing on a giant C cake,"" meaning the Lisp functionality was just a small layer on top of a much larger codebase written in the C programming language.

## Paul Graham's Role and Performance

Graham was hired specifically as a ""Lisp hacker"" to write applications using this Lisp scripting capability. This position at Interleaf was the closest thing to a normal job that he had experienced in his career.

### Self-Assessment of Performance

Graham is quite candid and self-critical about his performance at Interleaf, stating:

1. ""I was a bad employee"" - He directly apologizes to his former boss and coworkers
2. He admits he never understood most of the software because he didn't know C programming and wasn't motivated to learn it
3. He describes himself as ""terribly irresponsible""
4. He struggled with the conventional office hours structure, which he found ""unnatural"" (though he notes the world has since moved more toward his way of thinking about flexible work)
5. Toward the end of his time there, he was secretly working on his book ""On Lisp"" during company hours

After leaving Interleaf, Graham arranged to do freelance work for their customer projects team, which became his source of income for several years.

## Lessons Learned at Interleaf

Despite his self-described poor performance, Graham acknowledges learning valuable lessons at Interleaf that influenced his later ventures (Viaweb and Y Combinator):

1. Technology companies are better run by product people than sales people
2. Having too many people editing code leads to bugs
3. Cheap office space isn't worth it if it's depressing
4. Spontaneous corridor conversations are superior to planned meetings
5. Big, bureaucratic customers can be a dangerous source of money
6. Conventional office hours don't align well with optimal hacking time
7. Most importantly, he learned that ""the low end eats the high end"" - being the ""entry level"" option can be advantageous, even if less prestigious

This last lesson about the ""low end eating the high end"" became particularly significant in his later entrepreneurial ventures.

The author's role in the company was to write things in this scripting language, essentially functioning as a Lisp hacker. However, the author self-assesses his performance as poor. He admits to being a bad employee, stating that he didn't understand most of the software because their Lisp was just a thin layer on top of a large amount of C code, a language he didn't know and didn't want to learn.
