Describe the first computer he used for programming, the language he used, and the challenges he faced.","[""Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter."", 'The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.', 'What I Worked On\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called ""data processing."" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.', ""McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time."", 'With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]\n\nThe first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.', ""I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear."", 'I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I\'d never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. When you\'re working on an interpreter written in itself, it\'s hard to keep track of what\'s happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.\n\nSo I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I\'d ever worked on anything.

1. **Heinlein's Novel**: The novel ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" by Heinlein, which featured an intelligent computer named Mike, deeply influenced him. The depiction of such advanced AI made it seem only a matter of time before something similar could be achieved in reality.

2. **Terry Winograd's SHRDLU**: A PBS documentary showcasing Terry Winograd using SHRDLU—a program that could understand natural language within a limited domain—fascinated Graham. It gave him the impression that with a little more work, AI could achieve significant advancements.

Despite these influences, Paul Graham eventually realized that the approach to AI during his time was flawed. He found that the predominant AI methods involved translating simple sentences into formal representations, which he considered a ""hoax"". These methods did not truly understand natural language; they merely exposed a formal subset of language. He came to understand that this method, which relied on explicit data structures to represent concepts, was fundamentally broken and would never lead to truly intelligent systems like ""Mike.""","The two main influences that initially drew the author to AI were a novel by Heinlein called ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,"" which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU.

- **Historical Significance**: Lisp was originally intended as a formal model of computation rather than a conventional programming language. This unique origin as a model of computation granted Lisp a distinct power and elegance that captivated Graham during his college years, even though he didn't fully grasp why at the time.

- **Promise for AI**: During his time at Cornell, Lisp was regarded as the language of artificial intelligence (AI). As Graham was keen on AI, learning Lisp was a necessity, which broadened his understanding of programming significantly compared to other languages of that era.

- **Desire to Build**: Graham favored building systems over theoretical work. He found Lisp aligned with his practical interests because it allowed for the creation of innovative projects, like his work on new dialects of Lisp.

- **Hands-on Learning**: Graham decided to deepen his understanding by writing about Lisp. He noted that writing ""On Lisp,"" his book on Lisp hacking, was instrumental in his learning process despite initially knowing little about it.

- **Inventive Work**: Later, he worked on creating new dialects of Lisp, such as Arc. This effort furthered both his understanding and innovation within the language.","The author shifted his interest towards Lisp after realizing that the way AI was practiced at the time, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. He found that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, which was the main reason people cared about it at the time. To further his understanding of Lisp, he decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. He mentions that writing a book about something can help you learn it.

The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art""]","During his time in grad school, Paul Graham explored his dual interests in computer science and art, seeking ways to integrate these passions despite their distinct paths.

### Enrollment in Art Classes
While pursuing a PhD in computer science, Graham took advantage of the flexibility at Harvard to enroll in art classes. His advisor, Tom Cheatham, allowed him the freedom to explore these interests: ""Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor... was very easy going."" This highlights his active effort to engage in art alongside his technical studies.

### Art School Applications
Although initially focusing on computer science, Graham also applied to art schools, evidencing his serious pursuit of formal art education. He was accepted into the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and even moved there to start a BFA program in art. His experience in art education shows a tangible step towards reconciling his two interests.

### Publishing ""On Lisp""
Despite his passion for art, Graham kept a strong connection to computer science by working on a book, ""On Lisp,"" while at grad school. By focusing on Lisp hacking, a subject he was passionate about, he bridged his technical knowledge with a creative literary endeavor.

### Personal Art Exploration
Graham was essentially teaching himself to paint through various classes and personal exploration, indicating his commitment to art as more than just a hobby. He later decided to focus on this self-driven learning process outside the formal environment.

Ultimately, Graham handled his dual interests by balancing formal education in both fields and self-driven projects to develop his skills in computer science and art simultaneously.","The author in the essay is Paul Graham, who was pursuing a PhD in computer science but also developed an interest in art. He found himself in a complex situation where he was simultaneously exploring different fields and trying to reconcile his interests.

In terms of computer science, Graham was particularly interested in Lisp, a programming language. He decided to write a book about Lisp hacking, titled ""On Lisp,"" as a way to deepen his understanding of the language. He was also intrigued by the idea of building things that would last, which he felt was a challenge in the field of systems work in computer science as any program written would eventually become obsolete.

On the other hand, Graham also developed a fascination with art. He was inspired by a visit to the Carnegie Institute where he realized that paintings, unlike software, do not become obsolete and can last for hundreds of years. This realization led him to consider the possibility of becoming an artist himself. Despite having no prior experience, he started taking art classes at Harvard while still being in the PhD program.

Graham found himself working on multiple projects that were not related to his thesis. He was writing his book on Lisp, taking art classes, and still trying to complete his PhD. He was in a dilemma about how to reconcile his varied interests and find a way out of grad school.

A turning point came when his professor asked if he was ready to graduate. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham decided to write one in the remaining weeks before the deadline, reusing parts of his book ""On Lisp"" where he could. This decision reflects his attempt to reconcile his interests by integrating his work on Lisp into his academic obligations.",0.9999999999,1.0,0.8973116640872244,0.8181818181818182,0.42,0.5

A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\n\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.

And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]"", ""I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting.

This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish."", ""Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.\n\nI wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work.

8,"In the essay, the author discusses his experience with painting still lives. Based on his description, explain how the process of painting a still life differs from painting a person. What does the author suggest is the benefit of painting still lives in terms of visual perception?","[""While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the"", 'I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren\'t consciously aware of much we\'re seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain ""that\'s a water droplet"" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or ""that\'s a bush"" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there\'s a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.\n\nThis is not the only way to paint. I\'m not 100% sure it\'s even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.', ""[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing.

In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled.

Still lives remain stationary, allowing an artist to meticulously capture them over time, potentially even replicating each detail exactly as it is seen. In contrast, people can only sit for short periods and often do not remain perfectly still. Therefore, when painting people, artists typically start with a generic human form and adjust it to resemble the particular individual.

Graham highlights the benefit of painting still lives as the necessity for intense observation. He suggests that while we are generally unaware of the vast amount of visual information we perceive every day, painting requires us to pay close attention to these details. By observing closely, artists can discover new aspects of the subjects they paint, making the process enlightening and enhancing visual perception beyond mere photographic accuracy. Painting, therefore, becomes an exercise in understanding visual cues, making it possible to create paintings that are more realistic than photographs in capturing the essence of an object.","In the essay, the author explains that painting a still life is different from painting a person because the subject of a still life doesn't move, unlike a person who can't sit still for more than about 15 minutes. When painting people, the traditional method is to know how to paint a generic person, which is then modified to match the specific person being painted. In contrast, a still life can be copied pixel by pixel from what the artist is seeing.

The author suggests that painting still lives allows for a deeper understanding of visual perception. In everyday life, much of what we see is processed by low-level brain functions that provide a general understanding of what we're seeing, without detailing every aspect. However, when painting a still life, the artist must look more closely and notice details that are usually overlooked. The author notes that this process of careful observation can lead to new discoveries even after days of painting something that people usually take for granted. Therefore, painting still lives can enhance visual perception by encouraging a more detailed and conscious observation of the world.",0.99999999995,1.0,0.8959064519736829,1.0,0.73,1.0
