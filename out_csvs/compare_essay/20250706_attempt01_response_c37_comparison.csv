0,"In the essay, the author mentions his early experiences with programming. Describe the first computer he used for programming, the language he used, and the challenges he faced.","Based on the essay, here's what Paul Graham shares about his early programming experiences:

### First Computer Experiences

Paul Graham's first exposure to programming was on an IBM 1401 computer located in the basement of his junior high school when he was 13 or 14 years old. He describes this environment as ""like a mini Bond villain's lair"" with ""alien-looking machines ‚Äî CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader ‚Äî sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.""

### Programming Language

His first programming language was an early version of Fortran. He had to type programs on punch cards, stack them in a card reader, and press a button to load and run the program. The output would typically be printed on what he describes as a ""spectacularly loud printer.""

### Personal Computer

It wasn't until around 1980, after ""years of nagging,"" that his father bought him his own computer - a TRS-80. Although the Apple II was considered the ""gold standard"" at that time, the TRS-80 was ""good enough"" and this is when he ""really started programming.""

### Challenges and Limitations

Graham faced several challenges with his early programming:

1. **Limited Input Options**: On the IBM 1401, the only way to input data was through punched cards, and he didn't have any data stored this way.

2. **Limited Project Ideas**: He mentions being ""puzzled"" by the 1401 and ""couldn't figure out what to do with it."" Without input data, his programming options were severely restricted.

3. **Technical Limitations**: His programs on the TRS-80 had significant memory constraints. For example, the word processor he created for his father could only hold about 2 pages of text in memory at a time.

4. **Learning Curve**: He experienced the classic beginner's problem of creating an infinite loop, noting ""the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't."" This was both a ""social as well as a technical error"" because it tied up the shared machine.

With his TRS-80, he was able to write more practical programs, including simple games, a program to predict how high his model rockets would fly, and that word processor his father used to write at least one book.

Is there any specific aspect of his early programming experiences you'd like me to elaborate on further?","The first computer the author used for programming was the IBM 1401, which was used by his school district for data processing. He started using it in 9th grade, around the age of 13 or 14. The programming language he used was an early version of Fortran. The author faced several challenges while using this computer. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and he didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but he didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. Therefore, he couldn't figure out what to do with it and in retrospect, he believes there's not much he could have done with it.",0.8592591801648038,0.41,1.0
1,The author switched his major from philosophy to AI during his college years. What were the two specific influences that led him to develop an interest in AI? Provide a brief description of each.,"Based on the information I found, Paul Graham had two specific influences that led him to develop an interest in AI during his college years:

### 1. Heinlein's Novel ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress""
This science fiction novel featured an intelligent computer named Mike that captivated Graham's imagination. The book drew him completely into its world and made him believe that true artificial intelligence was achievable. In his own words, ""it seemed only a matter of time before we'd have Mike.""

### 2. PBS Documentary Featuring Terry Winograd Using SHRDLU
Graham watched a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd demonstrating SHRDLU, an early natural language understanding computer program. This demonstration had a profound effect on him, making him believe that advanced AI was ""a few years at most"" away. Graham was so inspired that he thought all they needed to do was ""teach SHRDLU more words.""

These two influences were so powerful that Graham ultimately decided to reverse-engineer SHRDLU for his undergraduate thesis, calling it a project he ""loved working on."" He even chose ""Artificial Intelligence"" as his degree focus in his flexible Cornell program that didn't require traditional majors.

What particularly interests you about Paul Graham's journey from philosophy to AI?","The two specific influences that led the author to develop an interest in AI were a novel and a documentary. The novel was ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" by Heinlein, which featured an intelligent computer named Mike. The author was drawn into the world of the novel and felt it was only a matter of time before we'd have an intelligent computer like Mike. The documentary was a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU, a computer program that used natural language processing. Seeing Winograd use SHRDLU made the author believe that the development of AI was imminent.",0.9067951390116145,0.67,1.0
2,"In the essay, the author discusses his initial interest in AI and his eventual disillusionment with it. According to the author, what were the two main influences that initially drew him to AI and what realization led him to believe that the approach to AI during his time was a hoax?","Based on Paul Graham's essay, I can provide insights about his initial interest in AI and later disillusionment.

### Two Main Influences That Drew Him to AI

Paul Graham was initially drawn to artificial intelligence by two specific influences:

1. **Heinlein's Novel**: ""A novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike."" This science fiction story created a world that Paul was ""drawn entirely into,"" making him believe intelligent computers were an inevitable future development.

2. **PBS Documentary on SHRDLU**: ""A PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU."" Seeing this AI program in action made such an impression on him that he believed we were only ""a few years at most"" away from having intelligent computers. He thought that ""all you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.""

These influences were so compelling that he decided to focus on AI rather than philosophy during his college years. He even reverse-engineered SHRDLU for his undergraduate thesis, which he described as ""already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.""

### His Realization About AI as a ""Hoax""

During his first year of graduate school at Harvard, Graham came to a pivotal realization:

> ""I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that's told 'the dog is sitting on the chair' translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.""

His key insight was that there was an ""unbridgeable gap"" between what these AI programs could do and actually understanding natural language. The fundamental approach at that time‚Äîusing ""explicit data structures representing concepts""‚Äîwas inherently limited:

> ""What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset... It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words.""

Graham realized that this entire approach to AI would never lead to truly intelligent machines like Mike from the novel. He saw that while the field was generating plenty of academic papers about ""band-aids"" for this approach, it was fundamentally flawed and ""was never going to get us Mike.""

This realization led him to shift his focus from AI to Lisp programming, which he found fascinating for its own merits independent of its connection to AI research.

Is there anything specific about Paul Graham's AI journey that you'd like me to explore further?","The two main influences that initially drew the author to AI were a novel by Heinlein called ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,"" which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. The realization that led him to believe that the approach to AI during his time was a hoax was that the AI programs of the time, which translated natural language into formal representations and added them to their knowledge base, were not truly understanding natural language. He realized that there was an unbridgeable gap between what these programs could do and actual understanding of natural language.",0.9028657201146366,0.47,1.0
3,"The author mentions his shift of interest towards Lisp, a programming language. What reasons does he provide for this shift and how did he further his understanding of Lisp?","Based on the information from Paul Graham's essay, here are the reasons he was drawn to Lisp and how he developed his understanding of it:

### üîç Why Paul Graham Was Drawn to Lisp

1. **Elegance and Power**: Graham was attracted to Lisp because of its ""power and elegance that other languages couldn't match"" compared to other programming languages of the time.

2. **Theoretical Origins**: He was fascinated by Lisp's origins as a formal model of computation (an alternative to the Turing machine) rather than just a programming language. He appreciated how John McCarthy had ""discovered"" rather than merely invented Lisp as a minimal set of operators needed to create a language interpreter.

3. **Contrast to Primitive Languages**: When Graham was in college, the commonly used programming languages (like PL/I) were ""pretty primitive."" Learning Lisp ""expanded [his] concept of a program so fast that it was years before [he] started to have a sense of where the new limits were.""

4. **Connection to AI**: Initially, his interest in Lisp came through his interest in artificial intelligence, as ""in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI."" When his AI plans didn't work out, he focused on Lisp itself.

### üìö How He Furthered His Understanding of Lisp

1. **Writing Books**: Graham wrote multiple books on Lisp:
   - ""On Lisp"" (published in 1993) - He admits: ""It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it.""
   - ""ANSI Common Lisp"" - A more popular book that could be used as a textbook

2. **Professional Work**: He worked at Interleaf, where they had added a dialect of Lisp as a scripting language. He was hired as a Lisp hacker to write programs in it.

3. **Creating His Own Lisp Dialects**: 
   - He created a dialect called ""Arc"" with someone named Dan
   - Later, he spent 4 years (from March 2015 to October 2019) developing ""Bel,"" a new Lisp written in itself that attempted to preserve the ""discoveredness"" quality of McCarthy's original Lisp

4. **Using Lisp in Business**: He used Lisp at Viaweb (his startup), which became the subject of a talk he gave at a Lisp conference

Graham's journey with Lisp spans decades, from his initial encounter in college to creating his own dialects later in life. The language clearly had a profound impact on his thinking and career, serving as both a practical tool for his startups and an intellectual pursuit for its own sake.

Is there any specific aspect of his relationship with Lisp you'd like to explore further?","The author shifted his interest towards Lisp after realizing that the way AI was practiced at the time, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. He found that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, which was the main reason people cared about it at the time. To further his understanding of Lisp, he decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. He mentions that writing a book about something can help you learn it. The book he wrote, ""On Lisp,"" was mostly written during his time in grad school.",0.9154731996607613,0.1,0.5
4,"In the essay, the author mentions his interest in both computer science and art. Discuss how he attempts to reconcile these two interests during his time in grad school. Provide specific examples from the text.","# üé® Paul Graham's Reconciliation of Computer Science and Art in Grad School

Based on Paul Graham's essay, I can see how he attempted to reconcile his interests in computer science and art during his graduate school years. This was a significant period of personal exploration for him as he navigated between these seemingly disparate fields.

## The Academic Path vs. The Artistic Path

While pursuing his PhD in computer science at Harvard, Graham found himself drawn to art in a profound way. During a visit to the Carnegie Institute (where he had spent time as a kid), he had a revelation:

> ""While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.""

This realization about the enduring nature of art stood in stark contrast to his work in computer science, particularly AI, which he was becoming increasingly disillusioned with.

## His Unconventional Approach in Grad School

Graham took an unusual approach to his graduate studies that allowed him to pursue both interests simultaneously:

> ""That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.""

This led to an interesting situation where he was effectively living a double life:

> ""So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.""

## Finding His Own Path in Both Worlds

While pursuing his PhD, Graham found a way to salvage something from his waning interest in AI - his love for Lisp programming:

> ""So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time.""

This led him to write ""On Lisp,"" a book about Lisp hacking, during his graduate school years.

Simultaneously, he was preparing for a life in art, applying to art schools while finishing his dissertation:

> ""I picked applications of continuations as the topic... But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely. Meanwhile I was applying to art schools.""

## The Tension Between Theory and Practice

In both fields, Graham seemed to gravitate toward the practical, hands-on aspects rather than the theoretical:

> ""Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things.""

Similarly, in art, he identified more with the students who wanted to improve their technical skills rather than those focused on developing a signature style:

> ""There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who 'could draw' in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better... I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.""

## The Resolution

Rather than fully reconciling these interests during grad school, Graham instead used this time to explore both paths before ultimately making a series of transitions - first finishing his PhD, then attending RISD for art, before eventually returning to programming with his startup Viaweb.

His grad school experience represents a period of coexistence rather than true integration of these interests, where he was actively pursuing both while trying to determine his future direction.

Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of Paul Graham's dual interests in more detail?","The author in the essay is Paul Graham, who was pursuing a PhD in computer science but also developed an interest in art. He found himself in a complex situation where he was simultaneously exploring different fields and trying to reconcile his interests.

In terms of computer science, Graham was particularly interested in Lisp, a programming language. He decided to write a book about Lisp hacking, titled ""On Lisp,"" as a way to deepen his understanding of the language. He was also intrigued by the idea of building things that would last, which he felt was a challenge in the field of systems work in computer science as any program written would eventually become obsolete.

On the other hand, Graham also developed a fascination with art. He was inspired by a visit to the Carnegie Institute where he realized that paintings, unlike software, do not become obsolete and can last for hundreds of years. This realization led him to consider the possibility of becoming an artist himself. Despite having no prior experience, he started taking art classes at Harvard while still being in the PhD program.

Graham found himself working on multiple projects that were not related to his thesis. He was writing his book on Lisp, taking art classes, and still trying to complete his PhD. He was in a dilemma about how to reconcile his varied interests and find a way out of grad school.

A turning point came when his professor asked if he was ready to graduate. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham decided to write one in the remaining weeks before the deadline, reusing parts of his book ""On Lisp"" where he could. This decision reflects his attempt to reconcile his interests by integrating his work on Lisp into his academic obligations.",0.9060332859759329,0.62,1.0
5,The author discusses his decision to write a book on Lisp hacking despite his limited knowledge about it. What reasons does he give for this decision and how does this reflect his approach to learning and problem-solving?,"Based on the essay, Paul Graham discusses his decision to write a book on Lisp hacking despite his limited knowledge. Here are the key insights about his approach:

### Reasons for Writing a Book on Lisp Despite Limited Knowledge

1. **Learning through teaching**: ""It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it."" This shows Graham's belief that teaching something is one of the best ways to learn it deeply.

2. **Genuine interest in Lisp**: ""I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI."" His intrinsic fascination with the language motivated him to explore it further.

3. **Salvaging from previous plans**: After his AI research plans didn't work out as expected, he looked for what he could salvage, and ""there was Lisp."" He pivoted to focus on what remained interesting to him.

4. **Financial considerations**: Later, when working at Interleaf, he mentions, ""I was nervous about money... So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp."" (He says this somewhat ironically, as writing Lisp books was hardly the path to riches.)

### How This Reflects His Approach to Learning and Problem-Solving

1. **Learning by doing**: Graham consistently puts himself in situations where he has to learn deeply by creating something substantial. He doesn't wait until he's an expert to begin projects.

2. **Following genuine curiosity**: Throughout the essay, he demonstrates following his interests rather than conventional paths. His work on Lisp came from genuine fascination with the language.

3. **Embracing challenges**: Taking on a book project about something he didn't fully understand shows his willingness to dive into challenging situations as learning opportunities.

4. **Long-term commitment**: The book ""On Lisp"" wasn't published until 1993, though he wrote much of it in grad school, showing his willingness to stick with difficult projects over extended periods.

5. **Building instead of just theorizing**: He notes, ""Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things."" This hands-on approach characterizes much of his learning style.

This pattern repeats in his later work on creating new Lisp dialects like Arc and Bel, where he would embark on ambitious projects driven by curiosity rather than existing expertise. His approach consistently shows that he learns through creation and exploration rather than through fully understanding something before starting.

Does this insight into Paul Graham's approach to learning through writing about topics he's still mastering interest you? Is there another aspect of his work or learning philosophy you'd like to explore?","The author decided to write a book on Lisp hacking primarily because he found Lisp interesting in its own right, separate from its association with AI. He also believed that writing a book about something is a good way to learn it. This reflects his approach to learning and problem-solving as being hands-on and experiential. He's not afraid to dive into a subject he's not fully versed in, using the process of writing and explaining to deepen his understanding. This approach suggests a willingness to take risks and learn through doing, rather than relying solely on prior knowledge or expertise.",0.9334901615653105,0.71,1.0
6,"In the essay, the author mentions a quick decision he made regarding his graduation. What was the decision and how did he plan to execute it?","Based on the information from the essay, here's what I found about the author's quick decision regarding his graduation:

### The Decision

In April 1990, Paul Graham ran into Professor Cheatham who asked him if he was far enough along to graduate that June. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham made what he described as ""the quickest bit of thinking in my life"" and decided to attempt writing his dissertation in the approximately 5 weeks that remained before the deadline.

### How He Planned to Execute It

1. He immediately responded to Professor Cheatham with ""Yes, I think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.""

2. He planned to write the dissertation rapidly in just 5 weeks.

3. He would reuse parts of his work ""On Lisp"" where possible.

4. He chose ""applications of continuations"" as his topic (though he later mentions he should have written about macros and embedded languages).

The gamble worked - Graham mentions that his ""rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely"" to complete his graduation requirements. It appears this quick decision was motivated by his desire to get out of grad school, as he had mentioned earlier feeling trapped in his situation.","The author decided to attempt writing his dissertation in the 5 weeks that remained before the deadline, despite not having a single word written yet. He planned to execute this by reusing parts of his work from ""On Lisp"" where he could.",0.9015830614095743,0.4,1.0
7,"The author describes the atmosphere and practices at the Accademia di Belli Arti. Based on his account, how did the students and faculty interact and what was the general approach to learning and teaching in this institution?","Based on Paul Graham's account, the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence presented quite a different educational environment than he had expected. Here's what he describes about the student-faculty interactions and teaching approaches:

### Atmosphere and Interactions at the Accademia

üèõÔ∏è **General Environment**
- Graham describes the Accademia as a ""(very civilized) joke"" with both students and faculty being ""the nicest people you could imagine""
- The institution adhered outwardly to the conventions of a 19th-century atelier, including traditional elements like a wood-burning stove with a nude model posed nearby
- The school had a significant number of foreign students (stranieri), who were required to take an entrance exam which local Italian students did not have to take

### Student-Faculty Relationship

- Graham notes that students and faculty ""had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything""
- He mentions his teacher, Professor Ulivi, as ""a nice guy"" who recognized Graham's hard work and gave him a good grade
- However, he explicitly states that ""the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian""

### Teaching and Learning Approach

- There appears to have been minimal structured instruction or rigorous curriculum
- Traditional artistic practices were present but not necessarily enforced - Graham mentions that despite having a nude model, ""hardly anyone else painted her besides me""
- Other students ""spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art"" rather than engaging in formal study
- The environment seemed to lack the educational rigor Graham had expected from ""the oldest art school""

Graham contrasts this with his later experience at RISD (Rhode Island School of Design), noting that while RISD was ""better organized"" and ""a lot more expensive,"" the painting department there was also ""post-rigorous"" and somewhat similar to the Accademia in its approach.

This portrayal suggests the Accademia operated more as a social artistic environment with traditional trappings rather than as a structured educational institution with a rigorous teaching methodology. The student-faculty dynamic appears to have been cordial but educationally undemanding by Graham's assessment.","According to the author's account, the students and faculty at the Accademia di Belli Arti had an arrangement where the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. The author describes this as an adherence to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. The students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines. The author also mentions that hardly anyone else painted the model besides him. This suggests that the general approach to learning and teaching in this institution was rather informal and not very rigorous.",0.9087492507321085,0.62,1.0
8,"In the essay, the author discusses his experience with painting still lives. Based on his description, explain how the process of painting a still life differs from painting a person. What does the author suggest is the benefit of painting still lives in terms of visual perception?","Based on Paul Graham's essay, here's how painting a still life differs from painting a person, and the benefits he found in still life painting:

## Differences Between Painting Still Lives vs. People

### Movement and Time
- **Still Lives**: As the name suggests, objects in a still life don't move. This allows the painter to observe them for extended periods without change.
- **People**: Graham notes that people ""can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still."" This significant difference affects the entire approach to painting.

### Approach to Painting
- **Still Lives**: Can be copied ""pixel by pixel"" from what the artist sees, allowing for meticulous observation and reproduction.
- **People**: Requires knowing how to paint ""a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting."" This is more of a template-based approach necessitated by the subject's movement.

### Observation Time
- **Still Lives**: Allow for extended, uninterrupted observation (days), enabling deeper perception.
- **People**: Limited sitting time forces a different technique with less direct observation.

## Benefits of Painting Still Lives for Visual Perception

Graham suggests several important benefits:

1. **Enhanced Visual Awareness**: ""In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing."" Still life painting forces you to look more closely at things we normally take for granted.

2. **Bypassing Mental Shortcuts**: Graham explains that normal visual perception is handled by ""low-level processes that merely tell your brain 'that's a water droplet' without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are."" Painting still lives requires overriding these shortcuts.

3. **Discovering Hidden Complexity**: ""When you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see."" He notes you can still be ""noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted.""

4. **Beyond Photographic Accuracy**: By emphasizing visual cues like the edge of an object where color changes, Graham suggests still life painters can create ""paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.""

Graham does mention that you can paint people like still lives ""if you want to, and they're willing,"" though ""the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters."" He considers this type of portrait ""arguably the apex of still life painting.""

What aspects of Paul Graham's experience with painting are you most interested in learning more about?","In the essay, the author explains that painting a still life is different from painting a person because the subject of a still life doesn't move, unlike a person who can't sit still for more than about 15 minutes. When painting people, the traditional method is to know how to paint a generic person, which is then modified to match the specific person being painted. In contrast, a still life can be copied pixel by pixel from what the artist is seeing.

The author suggests that painting still lives allows for a deeper understanding of visual perception. In everyday life, much of what we see is processed by low-level brain functions that provide a general understanding of what we're seeing, without detailing every aspect. However, when painting a still life, the artist must look more closely and notice details that are usually overlooked. The author notes that this process of careful observation can lead to new discoveries even after days of painting something that people usually take for granted. Therefore, painting still lives can enhance visual perception by encouraging a more detailed and conscious observation of the world.",0.0,0.8,1.0
9,"The author shares his work experience at a company called Interleaf. Describe the unique feature that Interleaf had added to their software and its significance. Also, discuss the author's role in the company and his self-assessment of his performance.","## Paul Graham's Experience at Interleaf

Based on the information, I can provide details about Paul Graham's experience at Interleaf, the unique software feature, and his self-assessment.

### The Unique Feature and Its Significance

‚ú® **Innovative Software Feature:**
Interleaf had added a scripting language to their document creation software, which was particularly notable because:
- It was inspired by Emacs
- The scripting language was actually a dialect of Lisp
- This was considered a ""bold"" move for a document creation software company

This feature was significant because it represented an attempt to add programming flexibility to document software, allowing for customization and automation. The addition of a Lisp dialect was particularly remarkable as Lisp was (and remains) a language favored by certain programmers for its powerful capabilities, but wasn't commonly integrated into commercial document software.

### Paul Graham's Role and Self-Assessment

üîπ **Role at Interleaf:**
- He was hired specifically as a ""Lisp hacker"" to write things using their Lisp scripting language
- This was described as ""the closest thing [he's] had to a normal job""
- Later, he arranged to do freelance work for the customer projects group

üîπ **Self-Assessment of His Performance:**
Graham is quite candid and critical about his own performance at Interleaf:
1. ""I was a bad employee"" (his direct words)
2. He admits he was ""terribly irresponsible""
3. He struggled with the traditional office hours, which ""seemed unnatural"" to him
4. He confesses that toward the end of his time there, he spent ""much of [his] time surreptitiously working"" on his book ""On Lisp""
5. He never fully understood most of the software because Lisp was ""the thinnest icing on a giant C cake"" and he ""didn't know C and didn't want to learn it""

### Lessons Learned at Interleaf

Despite his self-described poor performance, Graham notes that he ""learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do,"" including:
- Technology companies are better run by product people than sales people
- Too many people editing code leads to bugs
- Cheap office space is ""no bargain if it's depressing""
- Planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations
- Big, bureaucratic customers are ""a dangerous source of money""
- Traditional office hours and locations aren't optimal for programming/hacking

The experience at Interleaf, while not his most successful professional engagement by his own admission, provided valuable insights that influenced his future ventures, including Viaweb and Y Combinator.

What aspects of Paul Graham's Interleaf experience would you like to explore further?","Interleaf, the company where the author worked, had added a unique feature to their software. Inspired by Emacs, they incorporated a scripting language into their software, which was even made as a dialect of Lisp. This bold move was significant as it allowed for more complex and flexible operations within the software.

The author's role in the company was to write things in this scripting language, essentially functioning as a Lisp hacker. However, the author self-assesses his performance as poor. He admits to being a bad employee, stating that he didn't understand most of the software because their Lisp was just a thin layer on top of a large amount of C code, a language he didn't know and didn't want to learn. Additionally, he confesses to being terribly irresponsible, particularly in relation to the traditional working hours that were expected at the time.",0.0,0.62,1.0
