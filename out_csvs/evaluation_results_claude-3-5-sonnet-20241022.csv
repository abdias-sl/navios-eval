His first programming experience was on an IBM 1401 computer when he was 13 or 14 years old in 9th grade. This computer was located in the basement of his junior high school, where the school district used it for ""data processing."" He and his friend Rich Draves got permission to use it. He describes the computer room as being like a ""mini Bond villain's lair"" with alien-looking machines including a CPU, disk drives, printer, and card reader set up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.

The programming language he used was an early version of Fortran. The programming process was quite different from today:
- Programs had to be typed on punch cards
- The cards were stacked in a card reader
- You had to press a button to load and run the program
- Output was printed on what he describes as a ""spectacularly loud printer""

As for challenges, Graham mentions several limitations and difficulties:
1. Input was severely limited - the only way to input data was through punched cards, and he didn't have any data stored that way
2. The programming options were very restricted - he could only really write programs that didn't require input, like calculating pi, but he didn't know enough math to do anything interesting
3. He encountered his first infinite loop, which was particularly problematic because the machine didn't have time-sharing capabilities. This caused some tension with the data center manager!

It wasn't until later, around 1980, that Graham got his first personal computer - a TRS-80 - after years of convincing his father to buy one. While the Apple II was considered the ""gold standard"" at the time, the TRS-80 was where he really started programming more seriously, creating simple games, a model rocket flight predictor, and even a word processor that his father used to write a book (though it could only handle about 2 pages of text in memory at a time).

This transition to microcomputers was significant because it allowed for immediate interaction - you could type programs directly into the computer and get immediate responses, rather than having to work with punch cards and wait for results.

Would you like to know more about how these early experiences influenced his later programming career?","The first computer the author used for programming was the IBM 1401, which was used by his school district for data processing.

Initial Influences:
1. A novel by Heinlein called ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,"" which featured an intelligent computer named Mike
2. A PBS documentary showing Terry Winograd using SHRDLU (a natural language understanding computer program)

These influences were so powerful that Graham believed we were close to achieving true AI. As he mentions in the essay, after seeing SHRDLU in action, he thought we were just ""a few years at most"" away from achieving that level of artificial intelligence, believing that ""All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.""

The Realization:
During his first year of grad school, Graham came to the realization that AI (as practiced at that time) was what he called a ""hoax."" His specific criticism was directed at the contemporary approach to AI, which involved programs that would translate statements (like ""the dog is sitting on the chair"") into formal representations and add them to a database of knowledge.

The fundamental problem he identified was that these programs were only working with a very limited subset of natural language that could be treated as a formal language. As he explains: ""It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work.""

This realization led him to abandon AI research, though he did salvage his interest in Lisp programming, which had been closely associated with AI research at the time.

Is there anything specific about Graham's AI journey you'd like me to elaborate on?","The two main influences that initially drew the author to AI were a novel by Heinlein called ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,"" which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU.

Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.

Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.\n\nI wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work.

Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do."", ""McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way — indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough."", ""Interleaf had done something pretty bold.

Here are the key points:

1. Initial Exposure and Appeal:
- Graham first encountered Lisp while trying to teach himself AI at Cornell, where there weren't any AI classes at the time
- Lisp was considered the language of AI during that period
- Compared to other primitive programming languages of the time (like PL/I), Lisp significantly expanded his concept of what programming could be

2. Technical Appeal:
- Graham was attracted to Lisp's unique origins and design:
  - Lisp was originally created as a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine
  - It was distinctive because its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself
  - The language possessed power and elegance that other languages couldn't match

3. Deepening His Understanding:
Graham furthered his understanding of Lisp through several significant projects:
- Wrote a book called ""On Lisp"" (published in 1993), which helped him learn the language more deeply
- Worked at Interleaf, where he programmed in a Lisp dialect
- Wrote another book, ""ANSI Common Lisp,"" intended as a more popular, textbook-style work
- Created his own Lisp dialects:
  - Developed ""Arc,"" a new dialect of Lisp
  - Later spent 4 years (2015-2019) creating ""Bel,"" another Lisp implementation written in Arc

4. Professional Application:
- Used Lisp practically in his company Viaweb
- Gave talks about Lisp at conferences, sharing his experience of using it in business applications

Graham's journey with Lisp shows a progression from initial fascination to deep technical understanding, practical application, and eventually creating his own implementations of the language. His interest wasn't just academic; he saw value in the language's unique properties and applied it throughout his career in various contexts.

Would you like to know more about any specific aspect of Graham's work with Lisp, such as his development of Arc or Bel, or how he used it in his business ventures?","The author shifted his interest towards Lisp after realizing that the way AI was practiced at the time, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. He found that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, which was the main reason people cared about it at the time. To further his understanding of Lisp, he decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. He mentions that writing a book about something can help you learn it. The book he wrote, ""On Lisp,"" was mostly written during his time in grad school.",0.33333333331666665,0.8,0.8977786736138574,1.0,0.11,0.0

In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's a whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.\n\nMeanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\n\nI'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design."", 'In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.', ""In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.\n\nAnd moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get research funding."", 'I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I\'d visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who\'d invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\n\nI don\'t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that\'s told ""the dog is sitting on the chair"" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.', 'There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who ""could draw"" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.\n\nI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn\'t much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]', ""I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art"", ""She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet."", ""There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself.

In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.""]","Based on the essay, Paul Graham's attempt to reconcile his interests in computer science and art during his graduate school years reveals an interesting period of parallel pursuits and internal conflict. Here's how he managed these dual interests:

1. **Formal Academic Structure**
- Graham was officially in a PhD program in computer science at Harvard
- His advisor, Tom Cheatham, was ""very easy going"" and didn't object to Graham's unconventional course choices
- He took advantage of Harvard's policy allowing grad students to take classes in any department, and began taking art classes

2. **Multiple Concurrent Projects**
- He was simultaneously:
  - Working on his computer science PhD
  - Taking art classes
  - Working on ""On Lisp"" (a programming project he was passionate about)
  - Planning to become an artist
This reflects what Graham describes as typical grad student behavior: ""working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.""

3. **Transition Planning**
- While still in his CS program, he was already planning his exit strategy into art
- He applied to art schools, including RISD and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence
- His approach to his PhD dissertation was pragmatic: he chose a topic (applications of continuations) simply to complete the degree, later admitting he ""should have written about macros and embedded languages""

4. **Motivation for Art**
An important catalyst for his interest in art came during this period when he visited the Carnegie Institute. He had a significant realization about art that appealed to his practical side:
- Paintings don't become obsolete (unlike software)
- It was possible to make a living as an artist
- Art offered true independence - no boss or need for research funding

This period of Graham's life shows him not so much reconciling these interests as pursuing them in parallel, with an eventual plan to transition from computer science to art. The essay suggests that rather than finding a way to combine these interests, he was in a phase of transition, using his graduate studies as a bridge period while he explored and prepared for a potential career change into art.

The experience also reflects a larger pattern in Graham's life, which he acknowledges in the essay: repeatedly attending ""august institutions"" with high hopes about learning prestigious subjects, only to find himself disappointed with the formal education system, whether in computer science or later in art school.

What stands out about Graham's story is how he managed to maintain genuine passion for both fields simultaneously, even though they might seem at odds with each other. Does this dual pursuit of seemingly disparate interests resonate with any of your own experiences?","The author in the essay is Paul Graham, who was pursuing a PhD in computer science but also developed an interest in art. He found himself in a complex situation where he was simultaneously exploring different fields and trying to reconcile his interests.

In terms of computer science, Graham was particularly interested in Lisp, a programming language. He decided to write a book about Lisp hacking, titled ""On Lisp,"" as a way to deepen his understanding of the language. He was also intrigued by the idea of building things that would last, which he felt was a challenge in the field of systems work in computer science as any program written would eventually become obsolete.

On the other hand, Graham also developed a fascination with art. He was inspired by a visit to the Carnegie Institute where he realized that paintings, unlike software, do not become obsolete and can last for hundreds of years. This realization led him to consider the possibility of becoming an artist himself. Despite having no prior experience, he started taking art classes at Harvard while still being in the PhD program.

Graham found himself working on multiple projects that were not related to his thesis. He was writing his book on Lisp, taking art classes, and still trying to complete his PhD. He was in a dilemma about how to reconcile his varied interests and find a way out of grad school.

A turning point came when his professor asked if he was ready to graduate. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham decided to write one in the remaining weeks before the deadline, reusing parts of his book ""On Lisp"" where he could. This decision reflects his attempt to reconcile his interests by integrating his work on Lisp into his academic obligations.",0.9999999999,0.8,0.8985858781349932,0.9354838709677419,0.51,1.0
5,The author discusses his decision to write a book on Lisp hacking despite his limited knowledge about it. What reasons does he give for this decision and how does this reflect his approach to learning and problem-solving?,"[""So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time.

But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.\n\nComputer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for theory — indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves — but building things seemed so much more exciting."", ""I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]"", ""The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\n\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.

I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it\'s now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn\'t so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we\'d hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.\n\nBy then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an ""application service provider,"" or ASP. This name didn\'t last long before it was replaced by ""software as a service,"" but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.', ""In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished.

I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\nNotes"", 'Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we\'d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an ""internet storefront"" was something we already knew how to build.\n\nSo in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we\'d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores — in Lisp, of course.', ""Now they are, though.

1. **Learning Through Teaching**
Graham acknowledges his limited knowledge when he started writing the book ""On Lisp,"" stating: ""It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book."" However, he embraced this challenge because he recognized that ""there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it.""

2. **Financial Pragmatism**
Later, he wrote another Lisp book (""ANSI Common Lisp"") partly due to practical considerations. When his job at Interleaf seemed unstable, he saw writing a popular Lisp textbook as a way to maintain his independence and continue working with his preferred programming language rather than having to switch to other languages like C++.

3. **Deep Interest and Recognition of Value**
His decision to focus on Lisp came after recognizing its inherent value beyond its traditional association with AI. As he mentions, ""I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time.""

4. **Hands-On Learning Preference**
Graham's approach reflects his preference for building things rather than purely theoretical work. In computer science, he identified himself with the ""systems people"" who build things, rather than the ""theory people"" who prove things, though he respected both approaches.

This approach to learning and problem-solving reveals several key characteristics:

- **Practical Learning**: He believes in learning by doing and teaching others
- **Risk-Taking**: He's willing to tackle projects even without complete expertise
- **Self-Directed Learning**: Rather than waiting for formal instruction, he takes initiative to learn independently
- **Integration of Interests**: He finds ways to combine practical needs (earning a living) with his intellectual interests
- **Building to Learn**: He uses concrete projects (like writing books) as vehicles for deepening his understanding

Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of his learning approach in more detail?","The author decided to write a book on Lisp hacking primarily because he found Lisp interesting in its own right, separate from its association with AI. He also believed that writing a book about something is a good way to learn it. This reflects his approach to learning and problem-solving as being hands-on and experiential. He's not afraid to dive into a subject he's not fully versed in, using the process of writing and explaining to deepen his understanding. This approach suggests a willingness to take risks and learn through doing, rather than relying solely on prior knowledge or expertise.",0.9999999999,0.4,0.9362679780666054,1.0,0.0,1.0

When Professor Cheatham asked if he was far enough along to graduate that June, Graham hadn't written a word of his dissertation. However, in what he describes as ""the quickest bit of thinking in my life,"" he decided to attempt writing his entire dissertation in just 5 weeks before the deadline.

He executed this plan by:
1. Deciding to write about applications of continuations as the topic
2. Reusing parts from his work ""On Lisp"" where possible
3. Promising to give Professor Cheatham something to read within a few days

Graham mentions that in retrospect, he should have written about macros and embedded languages, noting there was ""a whole world there that's barely been explored."" However, his main motivation was simply to get out of grad school. The rapidly written dissertation was sufficient, though he notes it ""sufficed, just barely.""

This quick decision was particularly significant because Graham had been feeling trapped in grad school, even mentioning that he had envied his friend Robert Morris who had found a ""spectacular way to get out of grad school"" (albeit through getting kicked out for writing the internet worm of 1988). This spontaneous decision provided him with an unexpected exit strategy from a situation he had been struggling with.","The author decided to attempt writing his dissertation in the 5 weeks that remained before the deadline, despite not having a single word written yet.

Here are the key aspects of the student-faculty interactions and learning approach:

1. **Informal Agreement**
- There was an unspoken arrangement between students and faculty where:
  - Faculty wouldn't require students to learn anything
  - Students wouldn't require faculty to teach anything

2. **Surface-Level Traditions**
- The institution maintained outward appearances of a 19th-century atelier
- They even had traditional elements like a wood-burning stove with a nude model positioned nearby
- However, these traditional setups were largely ceremonial rather than functional

3. **Limited Engagement**
- Despite having traditional setups like nude models, Graham notes that hardly anyone besides himself actually painted the model
- Most students spent their time chatting or trying to imitate American art styles

4. **Faculty Attitude**
- Graham mentions his teacher, Professor Ulivi, as being ""a nice guy"" who appreciated Graham's hard work
- The faculty were described as ""the nicest people you could imagine""
- However, there appears to have been little actual instruction or guidance

5. **Overall Assessment**
- Graham characterizes the institution as a ""very civilized joke""
- The primary thing he learned there was Italian, rather than art
- The experience led him to realize this was another case of an ""august institution"" that would ultimately disappoint

6. **International Dynamic**
- There was a significant presence of foreign students (stranieri)
- The entrance exam was only required for foreign students, possibly as a way to limit their numbers
- This suggests some tension between maintaining the school's Italian character and its international appeal

This experience at the Accademia seems to have been part of a pattern Graham noticed in his education, where prestigious institutions didn't always deliver the rigorous education one might expect. The environment was pleasant and civilized, but lacking in substantive teaching and learning.

**Differences in Painting Process:**
- Still lives, as their name suggests, don't move, allowing the artist to study them for extended periods
- People can only sit for about 15 minutes at a time and tend to move even while sitting
- When painting people, artists typically rely on knowing how to paint a ""generic person"" which they then modify to match the specific subject
- With still lives, the artist can copy the subject ""pixel by pixel"" if desired, though the goal isn't mere photographic accuracy
- While it's possible to paint people like still lives, such portrait sessions tend to produce ""pained expressions in the sitters"" due to the long sitting time required

**Benefits for Visual Perception:**
Graham explains that still life painting enhances visual perception in several ways:
- It forces you to look more closely at what you're seeing
- In normal life, we're not consciously aware of much of what we see - our brain uses low-level processes that simply identify objects (""that's a water droplet"" or ""that's a bush"") without processing details
- When painting a still life, you must observe details like:
  - The lightest and darkest points
  - Where colors change suddenly
  - The edges of objects
  - Individual elements that would normally be processed automatically by the brain
- This detailed observation can lead to continued discoveries even after days of painting something people usually take for granted
- By emphasizing these visual cues in painting, Graham suggests you can create works that are ""more realistic than photographs"" in an ""information-theoretic sense""

Graham notes that this intense observational approach to painting isn't necessarily the only or best way to paint, but he found it worthwhile as a method for understanding visual perception and creating art. The process seems to align with his natural curiosity about seeing and understanding the world in greater detail.

Would you like to explore any particular aspect of Graham's painting experience in more detail?","In the essay, the author explains that painting a still life is different from painting a person because the subject of a still life doesn't move, unlike a person who can't sit still for more than about 15 minutes. When painting people, the traditional method is to know how to paint a generic person, which is then modified to match the specific person being painted. In contrast, a still life can be copied pixel by pixel from what the artist is seeing.

The author suggests that painting still lives allows for a deeper understanding of visual perception. In everyday life, much of what we see is processed by low-level brain functions that provide a general understanding of what we're seeing, without detailing every aspect. However, when painting a still life, the artist must look more closely and notice details that are usually overlooked. The author notes that this process of careful observation can lead to new discoveries even after days of painting something that people usually take for granted. Therefore, painting still lives can enhance visual perception by encouraging a more detailed and conscious observation of the world.",0.99999999995,1.0,0.9110034595071355,1.0,0.71,1.0

I learned that it's better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it."", ""This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server."", ""The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue combined with Yahoo's prematurely aged culture and grim cube farm in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf."", ""Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.\n\nI wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]"", 'But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it\'s good to be the ""entry level"" option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you\'re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.\n\nWhen I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.', ""[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them."", 'What I Worked On\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called ""data processing."" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.', ""The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last. Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.\n\nThere were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer lab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so off they went. That was what happened to systems work.\n\nI wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last."", ""I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.""]","Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive overview of the author's experience at Interleaf:

**Unique Software Feature:**
Interleaf had made a bold innovation by adding a scripting language to their document creation software, specifically making it a dialect of Lisp. This was inspired by Emacs, and they hired the author specifically as a Lisp programmer to work with this feature. However, this Lisp implementation was described as ""the thinnest icing on a giant C cake,"" suggesting it was a relatively small layer on top of a much larger C-based codebase.

**Author's Role and Self-Assessment:**
The author is quite candid about his performance at Interleaf, admitting he was ""a bad employee"" for several reasons:
1. He never fully understood most of the software because he didn't know C and wasn't interested in learning it
2. He describes himself as ""terribly irresponsible""
3. He struggled with the conventional office hours structure, which caused friction
4. Toward the end of his tenure, he spent much of his time secretly working on his own book ""On Lisp""

Despite his poor performance, the experience proved valuable as he learned several important business lessons about what not to do, including:
- Technology companies are better run by product people than sales people
- Too many people editing code leads to bugs
- Cheap but depressing office space is not worth the savings
- Planned meetings are less effective than informal corridor conversations
- Big, bureaucratic customers can be a dangerous source of money
- Conventional office hours and locations aren't optimal for programming work

After leaving Interleaf, he arranged to do freelance work for their customer projects group, which helped him survive financially for several years afterward.

The experience at Interleaf also taught him an important business principle that he later applied to his successful ventures (Viaweb and Y Combinator): ""the low end eats the high end."" This meant that being an ""entry level"" option, though less prestigious, can be advantageous in the market.","Interleaf, the company where the author worked, had added a unique feature to their software. Inspired by Emacs, they incorporated a scripting language into their software, which was even made as a dialect of Lisp. This bold move was significant as it allowed for more complex and flexible operations within the software.

The author's role in the company was to write things in this scripting language, essentially functioning as a Lisp hacker. However, the author self-assesses his performance as poor. He admits to being a bad employee, stating that he didn't understand most of the software because their Lisp was just a thin layer on top of a large amount of C code, a language he didn't know and didn't want to learn. Additionally, he confesses to being terribly irresponsible, particularly in relation to the traditional working hours that were expected at the time.",0.9999999999,0.8571428571428571,0.9146551376469859,1.0,0.58,1.0
